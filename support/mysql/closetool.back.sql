D. C.\n  1912.\n  Published by the Author.\n\n\n\n\n  Copyright, 1912\n  by\n  Robert Ridgway\n\n  PRESS OF\n  A. HOEN & COMPANY\n  BALTIMORE, MD\n\n\n\n\n  TO\n  Señor Don JOSÉ C. ZELEDÓN\n  OF\n  SAN JOSÉ, COSTA RICA\n\nTrue and steadfast friend for more than two-score years; host, guide,\nand companion on excursions among the glorious forests, magnificent\nmountains, and lovely plains of his native land; whose encouragement\nmade possible the completion of a seemingly hopeless task, this book\nis affectionately and gratefully dedicated.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThe motive of this work is THE STANDARDIZATION OF COLORS AND COLOR\nNAMES.\n\nThe terminology of Science, the Arts, and various Industries has been\na most important factor in the development of their present high\nefficiency. Measurements, weights, mathematical and chemical formulæ,\nand terms which clearly designate practically every variation of form\nand structure have long been standardized; but the nomenclature of\ncolors remains vague and, for practical purposes, meaningless, thereby\nseriously impeding progress in almost every branch of industry and\nresearch.\n\nMany works on the subject of color have been published, but most of\nthem are purely technical, and pertain to the physics of color, the\npainter\'s needs, or to some particular art or industry alone, or in\nother ways are unsuited for the use of the zoologist, the botanist,\nthe pathologist, or the mineralogist; and the comparatively few\nworks on color intended specially for naturalists have all failed to\nmeet the requirements, either because of an insufficient number of\ncolor samples, lack of names or other means of easy identification\nor designation, or faulty selection and classification of the colors\nchosen for illustration. More than twenty years ago the author of the\npresent work attempted to supply the deficiency by the publication\nof a book[1] containing 186 samples of named colors, but the effort\nwas successful only to the extent that it was an improvement on its\npredecessors; and, although still the standard of color nomenclature\namong zoologists and many other naturalists, it nevertheless is\nseriously defective in the altogether inadequate number of colors\nrepresented, and in their unscientific arrangement. Fully realizing his\nfailure, the author, some two or three years later, began to devise\nplans, gather materials, and acquire special knowledge of the subject,\nin the hope that he might some day be able to prepare a new work which\nwould fully meet the needs of all who have use for it. Unfortunately,\nhis time has been so fully occupied with other matters that progress\nhas necessarily been slow; but after more than twenty years of sporadic\neffort it has at last been completed.\n\nAcknowledgments are due to so many friends for helpful suggestions\nthat it is hardly possible to name them all, or to specify the extent\nor kind of help which each has rendered; but special mention should be\nmade of Mr. LEWIS E. JEWELL, of Johns Hopkins University; Dr. R. M.\nSTRONG, of the University of Chicago; Prof. W. J. SPILLMAN, of the U.\nS. Department of Agriculture; Mr. WILLIAMS WELCH, of the U. S. Signal\nService; Mr. MILTON BRADLEY, of Springfield, Mass.; Dr. P. G. NUTTING,\nof the U. S. Bureau of Standards; Mr. P. L. RICKER, of the Bureau of\nPlant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture; and Mr. J. L. RIDGWAY,\nof the U. S. Geological Survey. The late Professor S. P. LANGLEY, then\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was good enough to take a\nkindly interest in this undertaking and gave the author assistance\nfor which he is glad to make acknowledgment. More than to all others,\nhowever, is the author deeply indebted to Mr. John E. THAYER, of\nLancaster, Mass., and Señor Don JOSÉ C. ZELEDÓN, of San José, Costa\nRica, for aid so indispensible that without it the work could not have\nbeen completed.\n\nTo Dr. G. GRÜBLER & CO., of Leipzig, Germany, the author is under\nobligations for the gift of a nearly complete set of their celebrated\ncoal-tar dyes, which have proven quite necessary to the work,\nespecially in the coloring of the Maxwell disks on which the color\nscheme is based.\n\nThe reproduction of the plates has been a difficult matter, involving\nnot only expensive experimentation, but more than three years of\nunremitting labor. Vastly different from the ordinary lines of\ncommercial color work, the correct copying of each one of the 1115\ncolors of the original plates developed many perplexing and often\ndiscouraging problems, which were finally solved through Mr. A. B.\nHOEN\'S expert knowledge of chemistry and pigments; the skill, industry,\nand patience of the firm\'s head colorist, Mr. FRANK PORTUGAL, and the\npersonal interest of both these gentlemen. It is, therefore, with the\ngreatest pleasure that the author\'s grateful acknowledgment is made to\nthe firm of A. HOEN & COMPANY for the satisfactory manner in which they\nhave fulfilled their contract.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n                                                                   PAGE\n  PREFACE                                                             i\n\n  PROLOGUE                                                            1\n    Plan                                                              1\n    Color Names                                                       9\n    Color Terms                                                      15\n    Table of percentages of Component Colors in Spectrum Hues        21\n    Table of percentages of White and Black in Tone Scales           23\n    Table of percentages of Neutral Gray in Broken Colors            25\n    Table of percentages of Black and White in tones of Carbon Gray  25\n    Dyes and Pigments used in Coloring of Maxwell Disks              26\n    Alphabetical List of Colors represented on Plates                29\n    Colors of old edition Not Represented on Plates                  41\n    List of Useful Books on Color                                    42\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nAs stated in the Preface, the purpose of this work is the\nstandardization of colors and color nomenclature, so that naturalists\nor others who may have occasion to write or speak of colors may do so\nwith the certainty that there need be no question as to what particular\ntint, shade, or degree of grayness, of any color or hue is meant.\nTherefore, it is unnecessary to treat of the subject from any other\npoint of view; it will be sufficient to say that this work is based\non a thorough study of the subject from every standpoint, and that\npractically all authoritative works on the subject of color have been\ncarefully consulted.[2]\n\n\nPLAN. —The scientific arrangement of colors in this work is based\nessentially on the suggestions of Professor J. H. Pillsbury for a\nscheme of color standards,[3] which have also been the basis of several\nother efforts toward the same end, as the plates in Milton Bradley\'s\n\"Elementary Color\" and educational colored papers, Prang\'s charts of\nstandard colors, Klinkseick and Valette\'s \"Code des Couleurs,\" etc.;\nbut while all these present a scientifically arranged color-scheme and\nmore or less adequate number of colors they all fail to supply a ready\nor convenient means of identifying and designating the colors—the\nprincipal utility of a work of this kind. It is in the latter respect\nthat the present work is believed to meet, more nearly than any other\nat least, this essential requirement, and in this consists whatever\noriginality may be claimed for it.\n\nThe \"key\" to the classification or arrangement herewith presented is,\nof course, the solar spectrum, with its six fundamental colors and\nintermediate hues, augmented by the series of hues connecting violet\nwith red, which the spectrum fails to show. If, with the red-violets\nand violet-reds thus added to the spectrum hues, the band forming\nthis scale be joined end to end a circle is formed in which there is\ncontinuously a gradual change of hue, step by step, from red through\norange-red and red-orange to orange; orange through yellow-orange and\norange-yellow to yellow; yellow through green-yellow and yellow-green\nto green; green through blue-green and green-blue to blue; blue through\nviolet-blue and blue-violet to violet; and violet through red-violet\nand violet-red to red—the starting-point—with intermediate connecting\nhues. In the solar spectrum, both prismatic and grating, but especially\nthe former, the spaces between the adjoining distinct colors are very\nunequal; therefore for the present purpose an ideal scale must be\nconstructed, so that an approximately equal number of equally distinct\nconnecting hues shall be shown. Distinctions of hue appreciable to the\nnormal eye are so very numerous[4] that the criterion of convenience\nor practicability must determine the number of segments into which the\nideal chromatic scale or circle may be divided in order to best serve\nthe purpose in view. Careful experiment seems to have demonstrated\nthat thirty-six is the practicable limit, and accordingly that number\nhas been adopted.[5] If the number of intermediate hues were equal\nin all cases there would, in this scheme, be five between each two\nadjacent fundamental colors of the spectrum; but a greater number of\nrecognizably distinct hues is obviously necessary in some cases than in\nothers; for example, spectrum orange is decidedly nearer in hue to red\nthan to yellow, and therefore the number of intermediates required on\neach side of the orange is different, being in the proportion of four\nfor the red-orange series to five for the orange-yellow, and similarly\nsix are required for the violet-red series, while four suffice for the\nblue-violet hues.\n\nThere is no known means by which we can measure the proportion of\ntwo or more _pigments_ in any given mixture, \"because color-effect\ncannot be measured by the pint of mixed paint or the ounce of dry\npigment;\"[6] but, fortunately, we have a very exact method, in the\ncolor-wheel and Maxwell disks, by which the relative proportions of\ntwo or more _colors_ in any mixture may be precisely measured. This\nmethod has been used in the painting of every one of the 1115 colors\nof the present work, by means of one disk to represent each one of the\nthirty-six colors (both pure and \"broken\"), together with a black, a\nwhite, and a neutral gray disk, the last being a match in color to\nthe gray resulting from the mixture of red, green and violet on the\ncolor-wheel;[7] the neutral gray disk, however, being used only for\nthe making of disks for the broken series of colors (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′,\nand ′′′′′) and for the scale of neutral grays (Plate LIII.) These\ncolored disks are slit on one side from center to circumference, and\ntherefore by interlocking two or more they may be adjusted so that\neither occupies any desired percentage of the whole area, which may be\nvery precisely determined by a scale of 100 segments shown on the outer\nedge of a larger disk on which the colored disks are superimposed. When\nconnected with the color-wheel and adjusted as may be desired, and then\nrapidly revolved, the two or more distinct colors resolve themselves\ninto a single uniform composite color, whose elements are shown, in\ntheir relative proportion, by the scale surrounding the disks.[8]\n\nThe scales (both horizontal and vertical) of the present work are\nall prepared directly from definite color-wheel formulæ, based on\ncarefully calculated curves; the thirty-six pure spectrum hues,\nrepresented by the middle horizontal line of color-squares on Plates\nI-XII (together with an equal number of intermediates represented by\nblank spaces), requiring a separate curve and consequently different\nrelative proportions of the two component colors for each series\nof hues—that is, the series from red to orange, orange to yellow,\nyellow to green, green to blue, blue to violet, and violet to red,\nrespectively; but the progressive increments of white in the scales\nof tints, black in those of shades, and neutral gray in the several\nseries of broken colors are exactly the same in every case. The first\nseries of Plates (I-XII) shows the pure, full spectrum colors and\nintermediate hues (middle horizontal line, nos. 1-72),[9] each with its\nvertical scale of tints (upward, _a-g_) and shades (downward, _h-n_),\nthe increments of white for the tints being 9.5, 22.5, and 45 per\ncent., respectively, those of black in the shades being 45, 70.5, and\n87.5 per cent. The remaining Plates show these same thirty-six colors\nor hues in exactly the same order and similarly modified (vertically)\nby precisely the same progressive increments of white (upward) and\nblack (downward), but all the colors are dulled by admixture of neutral\ngray; the first series (1′-72′, Plates XIII-XXVI) containing 32 per\ncent. of neutral gray, the second (1′′-72′′, Plates XXVII-XXXVIII) 58\nper cent., the third (1′′′-72′′′, Plates XXXIX-XLIV) 77 per cent.,\nand the fourth (1′′′′-72′′′′, Plates XLV-L) 90 per cent. The last\nthree Plates (LI-LIII) show the six spectrum colors[10] (also purple,\nthe intermediate between violet and red) still further dulled by\nadmixture of 95.5 per cent. of neutral gray, these being in reality\ncolored grays; to which are added a scale of neutral gray and one of\ncarbon gray, the former being the gray resulting from mixture of the\nthree primary colors (red 32, green 42, violet 26 per cent., which in\nrelative darkness equals black 79.5, white 20.5 per cent.); the latter\nbeing the gray produced by mixture of lamp black and Chinese white, and\nthe scale a reproduction of that in the author\'s first \"Nomenclature of\nColors\" (1886, Plate II, nos. 2-10). It should be emphasized that in\nall cases except the scale of carbon grays, only the disks representing\nthe middle horizontal series of colors (both pure and broken) have been\nused, in combination with a black and a white disk, respectively, to\nmake the colors of the vertical scales of tints and shades.\n\nThe coloring of a satisfactory set of disks to represent the thirty-six\npure spectrum colors and hues was a matter of extreme difficulty, many\nhundreds having been painted and discarded before the desired result\nwas achieved. Several serious problems were involved, the matter of\nchange of hue through chemical reaction of the combined pigments or\ndyes[11] (especially the latter) being almost as troublesome as that\nof securing the proper degree of difference between each adjoining\npair of hues. The method by which satisfactory results were finally\nsecured was as follows: First, six disks were colored to represent\neach of the fundamental spectrum colors, according to the author\'s\nconception of them.[12] These six disks were then placed against a\nsuitable background (a neutral gray), in spectrum sequence, with wide\nintervals for the accommodation of connecting series of disks, which\nwere then colored so as to represent an apparently even transition\nfrom one to the other. When this very difficult task had been done as\nwell as the eye alone could judge, each intermediate was then measured\non the color-wheel and the relative proportions (in percentages) of\nits two component colors recorded. After this had been done for all\nthe intermediate hues each series (the red-orange, orange-yellow,\nyellow-green, green-blue, blue-violet, and violet-red) was taken\nseparately and a curve constructed on cross-section paper from the\nrecorded ratios. These curves were found to be in all cases more or\nless irregular or unsymmetrical, but nevertheless were sufficiently\nnear correct to serve as a basis for a symmetrical curve; and after the\npoints out of proper line were suitably relocated the two component\ncolors were correspondingly readjusted on the color-wheel and each\nfaulty disk corrected (or a new one painted) until it exactly matched\nthe required combination. The scales representing the tints and shades\nof each color, and also the gray or broken colors were similarly\ndetermined by corrected curves.[13]\n\nBy the method adopted of running each of the thirty-six spectrum hues\nthrough a scale of tints and shades, and repeating the combination\nthrough several series modified by increasing increments of neutral\ngray, practically the entire possible range of color variation is\ncovered,[14] rendering it an easy matter to locate in the plates,\neither among the colors actually shown or in an intermediate space,\nany color which it is desired to match; and where short distinctive\nnames have not been found (their place being, tentatively, supplied by\ncompound names), as, necessarily, must often be the case, any color\nor intermediate between any two colors, either as to hue, tint, or\nshade, may be readily designated by the very simple system of symbols\n(numerals and letters) employed.[15]\n\nIn order to designate any color for which a satisfactory name cannot\nbe found, or one not represented on the plates, it is only necessary\nto proceed as follows: Suppose the color in question is nearest 1 on\nPlate I; say, for example, is intermediate in hue between 1 (spectrum\nred) and 3 (scarlet-red), or in other words if represented in color its\nposition would be in the uncolored space designated as no. 2; and in\ntone between the full color (middle horizontal line) and tint _b_. Its\ndesignation, therefore, is _2a_. Exactly the same method applies to any\nof the other blank spaces, as well as to the colors themselves, except\nthat in case of the broken colors the \"primes\" (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′, or\n′′′′′) are to be affixed to the hue number. First locate the _hue_,\ndesignated by number, then the _tone_, designated by lower case letter,\nthe full, pure colors of the middle horizontal row being designated by\nnumber alone.\n\nColor Names.—While it is true that the naming of colors as usually\nemployed has so little to do with the purely technical aspects of\nchromatology or color-physics that, as Von Bezold remarks[16] \"we are\nin reality dealing with the peculiarities of language,\" it is equally\ntrue that a collection of color standards designed expressly for the\npurpose of identifying and designating particular colors can best\nattain this object by the use of a carefully selected nomenclature.\nIn other words, the prime necessity is to standardize both colors and\ncolor names, by elimination of the element of \"personal equation\"\nin the matter. In no other way can agreement be reached as to the\ndistinction between \"violet\" and \"purple,\" two color names quite\ngenerally used interchangeably or synonymously but in reality belonging\nto quite distinct hues, or that any other color name can be definitely\nfixed. Various methods of handling the matter of color in zoological\nand botanical descriptions, etc., by the avoidance of color names and\nsubstitution therefor of symbols, numerals, or mechanical contrivances\n(as color-wheel and spectrum analyses, color-spheres, etc.) have been\ndevised but all have been found impracticable or unsatisfactory.\nThe author has taken the trouble to get an expression of opinion in\nthis matter from many naturalists and others, and the preference for\ncolor-names very greatly predominates; consequently, whenever it has\nbeen possible to find a name which seems suitable for any color in\nthis work it has been done, leaving as few as possible unnamed, and\nfor these some other means must be devised for their designation. (See\npage 8). The selection of appropriate names for the colors depicted on\nthe Plates has been in some cases a matter of considerable difficulty.\nWith regard to certain ones it may appear that the names adopted are\nnot entirely satisfactory; but, to forestall such criticism, it may be\nexplained that the purpose of these Plates is not to show the color\nof the particular objects or substances which the names suggest, but\nto provide appropriate, or at least approximately appropriate, names\nfor the colors which it has seemed desirable to represent. In other\nwords, certain colors are selected for illustration, for which names\nmust be provided; and when names that are exclusively pertinent or\notherwise entirely satisfactory are not at hand, they must be looked\nup or invented. It should also be borne in mind that almost any object\nor substance varies more or less in color; and that therefore if\nthe \"orange,\" \"lemon,\" \"chestnut\" or \"lilac\" of the Plates does not\nexactly match in color the particular orange, lemon, chestnut or lilac\nwhich one may compare it with, it may (in fact does) correspond with\nother specimens. Without standardization, even if arbitrary, color\nnomenclature must, necessarily, remain in its present condition of\nabsolute chaos. Even the standard pigments are not constant in color,\npractically every one of them being subject to more or less variation\nin hue or tone, different samples from the same manufacturer sometimes\nvarying to the extent of several tones or hues of the present work;\nindeed, in every case where two or more samples of the same color\nhave been compared it has been found that no two are exactly alike,\nthe difference often being very great. For example: Of five samples\nof \"vandyke brown\" only two are approximately similar, each of the\nother three being widely different, not only from one another but from\nthe other two, one being a blackish brown, another reddish brown, the\nthird a yellowish orange-brown. Of eleven samples of \"olive\" no two\nare closely similar, the color ranging from a shade of dull (grayish)\nblue-green to orange-brown, dark brownish gray, and light yellowish\nolive; and the same or nearly the same degree of variation is seen\nin absolutely every color examined, showing very clearly the utter\nworthlessness of color names unless fixed or standardized.\n\nIn order to obtain as many color names as possible for standardization\nit has been necessary to draw from all available sources. Several\nthousand samples of named colors have therefore been collected, and\nfor convenience of reference and comparison gummed to card catalogue\ncards, with the name, source, and other data thereon. These include\nthe colors from many standard works, among them Werner\'s \"Nomenclature\nof Colours\" (Syme\'s edition, 1821), Hay\'s \"Nomenclature of Colours\"\n(1846), Ridgway\'s \"Nomenclature of Colors\" (1886), Saccardo\'s\n\"Chromataxia\" (1891), Mathews\' \"Chart of Correct Colors of Flowers\"\n(American Florist, 1891), Willson and Calkins\' \"Familiar Colors,\"\nOberthur and Dauthenay\'s \"Repertoire des Couleurs\" (1905), Leidel\'s\n\"Hints on Tints\" (1893), \"Lefévré\'s Matieres Colorantes Artificiales\"\n(1896), the Standard Dictionary chart of \"typical colors,\" the\neducational colored papers of Milton Bradley and Prang, and many\nothers; and besides these practically all of the artists\' oil, water,\nand dry colors, manufactured by Winsor and Newton, F. Schoenfeld and\nCo., Charles Roberson and Co., George Rowney and Co., Madderton and\nCo., R. Ackermann and Co., Bourgeois, Binant, Chenal, Le Franc, Devoe,\nRaynolds, Osborne, Bradley, Hatfield and others; also the coal-tar or\naniline dyes of Dr. G. Grübler & Co., Continental Color and Chemical\nCo., and Henry Heil Chemical Co., and the well known Diamond Dyes;\nchromo-lithographic inks, embroidery silks, etc., etc.\n\nThe material from which to select suitable color names was greatly\naugmented, almost at the last moment, from two sources, as follows: (1)\nA very large collection of color-samples (unfortunately mostly unnamed)\ncollected and mounted on cards by Mr. Frederick A. Wampole, a talented\nyoung artist, to whom was delegated, by a Committee of the American\nMycological Society, the task of preparing a nomenclature of colors\nbased upon spectroscopic determinations, but which, unfortunately,\nthe untimely death of Mr. Wampole prevented from progressing beyond\nthe accumulation of this collection. For the use of this material I\nam indebted to the courtesy of Dr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist of\nthe U. S. Department of Agriculture, and Mr. P. L. Ricker, Assistant\nBotanist, Bureau of Plant Industry, in the same Department. (2) A\nsplendid collection of colored Japanese silks, taffetas, velvets, and\nother dress goods, kindly sent me by Mr. C. H. Hospital, of the silk\ndepartment of the firm of Woodward and Lothrop, Washington, D. C. The\nvery large number of colors represented in this collection are all\nnamed and have afforded a considerable number of the names adopted in\nthe present work.\n\nFor obvious reasons it has, of course, been necessary to ignore many\ntrade names, through which the popular nomenclature of colors has\nbecome involved in really chaotic confusion rendered more confounded\nby the continual coinage of new names, many of them synonymous and\nmost of them vague and variable in their application. Most of them\nare invented, apparently without care or judgment, by the dyer or\nmanufacturer of fabrics, and are as capricious in their meaning as in\ntheir origin; for example: Such fanciful names as \"zulu,\" \"serpent\ngreen,\" \"baby blue,\" \"new old rose,\" \"London smoke,\" etc., and such\nnonsensical names as \"ashes of roses\" and \"elephant\'s breath.\" An\ninspection of the sample books of manufacturers of fancy goods (such\nas embroidery silks and crewels, ribbons, velvets, and other dress-\nand upholstery-goods) is sufficient not only to illustrate the\nabove observations, but to show also the absolute want of system or\nclassification and the general unavailability of these trade names for\nadoption in a practical color nomenclature. This is very unfortunate,\nsince many of these trade names have the merit of brevity and euphony\nand lack only the quality of stability.\n\nIt has been difficult for the author to decide whether the standards\nof his original \"Nomenclature of Colors\" (1886) should be retained\nin the present work. Some of them are admittedly wrong (indeed,\ncertain ones are not as they were intended to be); besides, owing to\nthe method of reproducing the originals (hand stenciling) there is\nconsiderable variation in different copies of the book, one or more\nreprints, necessitating new mixtures of pigments, adding to this lack\nof uniformity.[17] Many persons, however, have urged the retention of\nthe old standards, on the ground that they have been used by so many\nzoologists and botanists in their writings during the last twenty-five\nyears that they have become established through common usage. This\nvery important consideration has induced the author to retain such of\nthe old standards as can be matched in the present work, even though\nsome of them do not agree strictly with either his own or the usual\nconception of the colors in question. An asterisk (*) preceding a color\nname indicates that the name in question is adopted from the older\nwork, the variation between different copies of the work requiring\nthe selection, in the new one, of a color representing as nearly as\npossible an average of the former.\n\nIn any systematically arranged scheme, unless the number of colors\nshown is practically unlimited, it will, necessarily, be impossible\nto find represented thereon a certain proportion of colors comprised\namong even a very limited number selected at random, or only roughly\nclassified. Hence many (thirty-six, or more than five per cent.) of the\ncolors shown in the old \"Nomenclature of Colors\" fall into the blank\nintervals of the present work, being intermediate either in hue or\ntone, or chroma, sometimes all. It is necessary of course to provide\nsome means for the correlation of these with the present scheme, which\nis done by the list on page 41, where the position of each is shown.\n\nThe question of giving representations of metallic colors in this\nwork was at one time considered; but the idea was abandoned for the\nreason that these are in reality only ordinary colors reflected from\na metallic or burnished surface, or appearing as if so reflected; the\nactual hue is precisely the same, though often changeable according to\nangle of impact of the light rays, and relative position of the eye,\nthis changeableness being sometimes due to interference.[18] Colors\nagain vary, without actual difference of hue, in regard to quality of\ntexture or surface; that is to say, the color may be quite lustreless,\nappearing on a dull, sometimes velvety surface, while again it may be\nmore or less glossy, even to the degree of appearing as if varnished.\nTo deal with these variations, however, requires simply the use of\nsuitable adjectives. For example: To indicate a color which has no\nlustre or brightness, the adjective matt (or mat) may be used, in\npreference to _dull_, which implies reduction in purity or chroma;\nother adjectives, appropriate in special cases, being velvety, glossy,\nburnished metallic, matt-metallic, etc.\n\nColor Terms.—No other person has presented so forcibly the urgent need\nfor reform in popular nomenclature nor stated so clearly and concisely\nits shortcomings and the simple remedy, as Mr. Milton Bradley, from\none of whose educational pamphlets on the subject[19] the following is\nquoted: \"The list of words now employed to express qualities or degrees\nof color is very small, in fact a half dozen comprise the more common\nterms, and these are pressed into service on all occasions, and in such\nvaried relations that they not only fail to express anything definite\nbut constantly contradict themselves.... Tint, Hue and Shade are\nemployed so loosely by the public generally, even by those people who\nclaim to use English correctly, that neither word has a very definite\nmeaning, although each is capable of being as accurately used as any\nother word in our every day vocabulary\"....\n\nCertainly one would expect that men of learning, at least, would employ\nthe broader color terms correctly; but some of the highest authorities\non color-physics habitually use them interchangeably, as if they were\nquite synonymous; and even the dictionaries, with few exceptions, give\nincorrect or \"hazy\" definitions of these terms. It is not strictly\ncorrect to say a \"dark tint\" or \"light shade\" of any color, because a\n_tint_ implies a color _paler_ than the full color, while a shade means\nexactly the opposite; and to say an \"orange shade (or tint) of red,\"\na \"greenish shade (or tint) of blue,\" a \"bluish shade (or tint) of\nviolet,\" etc., is an absurdity, for the term _hue_, which specifically\nand alone refers to relative position in the spectrum scale, without\nreference to lightness or darkness, is the only one which can correctly\nbe used in such cases.\n\nIndeed the standardization of color terms is almost if not quite\nas important, in the interest of educational progress, as that of\nthe colors themselves and their names; therefore, to make easy a\nclear understanding of the specific meaning of each, the following\ndefinitions are given:—\n\n_Color._—The term of widest application, being the only one which can\nbe used to cover the entire range of chromatic manifestation; that is\nto say, the spectrum colors (together with those between violet and\nred, not shown in the spectrum) with all their innumerable variations\nof luminosity, mixture, etc. In a more restricted sense, applied to the\nsix distinct spectrum colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and\nviolet), which are sometimes distinguished as _fundamental colors_ or\n_spectrum colors_.\n\n_Hue._—While often used interchangeably or synonymously with color,\nthe term _hue_ is more properly restricted by special application\nto those lying between any contiguous pair of spectrum colors (also\nbetween violet and purple and between purple and red); as an orange\n_hue_ (not shade or tint, as so often incorrectly said) of red; a\nyellow _hue_ of orange; a greenish _hue_ of yellow; a bluish _hue_ of\ngreen; a violet _hue_ of blue, etc.\n\n_Tint._—Any color (pure or broken) weakened by high illumination or\n(in the case of pigments) by admixture of white, or (in the case of\ndyes or washes) by excess of aqueous or other liquid medium; as, a\ndeep, medium, light, pale or delicate (pallid) _tint_ of red. The term\ncannot correctly be used in any other sense.\n\n_Shade._—Any color (pure or broken) darkened by shadow or (in the case\nof pigments) by admixture of black; exactly the opposite of _tint_; as\na medium, dark, or very dark (dusky) _shade_ of red.\n\n_Tone._—\"Each step in a color scale is a tone of that color.\"[20]\nThe term tone cannot, however, be properly applied to a step in the\nspectrum scale, in which each contiguous pair of the six distinct\nspectrum or \"fundamental\" _colors_ are connected by _hues_. Hence\n_tone_[21] is exclusively applicable to the steps in a scale of\na single color or hue, comprising the full color (in the center)\nand graduated tints and shades leading off therefrom in opposite\ndirections; or of neutral gray similarly graduated in tone from the\ndarkest shade to the palest tint. Each one of the colored blocks in the\nvertical scales of the plates in this work represents a separate tone\nof that color.\n\n_Scale._—A linear series of colors showing a gradual transition from\none to another, or a similar series of tones of one color. The first\nis a _chromatic scale_[22] (or scale of colors and hues) and in the\nplates of this work is represented by each horizontal series; the\nsecond is a _tone scale_, on the plates running vertically, growing\nfrom the full color, in the center, to a pale tint (at the top) and\na dark shade (at the bottom). For clearer comprehension of these\ntwo distinct scales, each plate of this work may be compared to a\nsheet of woven fabric; the chromatic scale (horizontal) representing\nthe warp, the luminosity or tone scale (vertical) the woof. A third\nkind of color scale is represented by adding progressive increments\nof neutral gray to any color. This is shown by the several series\nof Plates, of which the first (Plates I-XII, with colors numbered\n1-71) represents each step in the spectrum scale unmixed with gray,\nfollowed by five other series in which the same colors[23] are shown\ndulled by gradually increasing increments of neutral gray, the first\n(Plates XIII-XXVI, colors 1′-71′) containing 32 per cent., the second\n(Plates XXVII-XXXVIII, colors 1′′-71′′) 58 per cent., the third (Plates\nXXXIX-XLIV, colors 1′′′-69′′′) 77 per cent., the fourth (Plates XLV-L,\ncolors 1′′′′-69′′′′) 90 per cent., and the fifth (Plates LI-LIII,\ncolors 1′′′′′, 15′′′′′, 23′′′′′, 35′′′′′, 49′′′′′, 59′′′′′ and 67′′′′′)\n95.5 per cent. of gray, the last being in reality colored grays.\nFinally scales are shown (on Plate LIII) of neutral gray (in which\nall trace of color is wanting), and of carbon gray, a simple mixture\nof lamp-black and chinese white. It is not easy to find a suitable\nname for these scales of reduced or \"broken\" colors, but they may, for\npresent convenience, be termed _reduced_ or _broken scales_.\n\n_Full Color._—A color corresponding in intensity with its\nmanifestation in the solar spectrum.\n\n_Pure Color._—A color corresponding in purity with (or, in the case of\nmaterial colors, closely approximating to) one of the spectrum colors.\n\n_Broken Color._—Any one of the spectrum colors or hues dulled or\nreduced in purity by admixture (in any proportion) of neutral gray, or\nvarying relative proportions of both black and white; also produced\nby admixture of certain spectrum colors, as red with green, orange\nwith blue, yellow with violet, etc. These broken colors are far more\nnumerous in Nature than the pure spectrum colors, and include the\nalmost infinite variations of brown, russet, citrine, olive, drab, etc.\nThey are often called dull or neutral colors.\n\n_Fundamental Colors._—The six psychologically distinct colors of the\nsolar spectrum; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet.\n\n_Primary Colors._—Theoretically, any of the spectrum colors which\ncannot be made by mixture of two other colors. According to the\ngenerally accepted Young-Helmholtz theory, the primary colors are\nred, green, and violet: orange and yellow resulting from a mixture of\nred and green, and blue from a mixture of green and violet. There is\nconsiderable difference of opinion, however, as to this question, and\nfurther investigation of the subject seems to be required; at any rate,\nauthorities fail to explain why red may be exactly reproduced (except\nas to the degree of luminosity) by a mixture of orange and violet,\nexactly as yellow results from mixture of red and green or blue from\ngreen or violet, green being, in fact, the only spectrum color that\ncannot be made by mixture of other colors.[24]\n\n_Chroma._—Degree of freedom from white light; purity, intensity or\nfullness of color.\n\n_Luminosity._—Degree of brightness or clearness. The relative\nluminosity of the spectrum colors is as follows: [Yellow (brightest)?],\norange yellow; orange; greenish-yellow, yellow-green, and green;\norange-red; red and blue (equal); violet-blue, blue-violet, violet.[25]\n\n_Warm Colors._—The colors nearer the red end of the spectrum or those\nof longer wave-lengths (red, orange, and yellow, and connecting hues)\n\"and combinations in which they predominate.\"[26]\n\n_Cool, or Cold, Colors._—The colors nearer the violet end of\nthe spectrum or those of shorter wave-length, especially blue and\ngreen-blue. \"But it is, perhaps, questionable whether green and violet\nmay be termed either warm or cool.\"\n\n_Complementary Color._—\"As white light is the sum of all color, if\nwe take from white light a given color the remaining color is the\ncomplement of the given color.\" When any two colors or hues which when\ncombined in proper proportion on the color-wheel produce, by rotation,\nneutral gray, these two colors each represent the complementary of the\nother.\n\n_Constants of Color._—The constants of color are numbers which measure\n(1) the wave-length, (2) the chroma, and (3) the luminosity.\n\nIn addition to the terms defined above there are many others, for which\nthe reader is referred to the chapter on \"Color Definitions\" on pages\n23-30 of Milton Bradley\'s excellent and most useful book \"Elementary\nColor.\"\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF PERCENTAGES OF COMPONENT COLORS IN THE CONNECTING HUES OF THE\nCHROMATIC SCALE.\n\n\nThe following table shows the relative percentages, in color-wheel\nmeasurement, of the two components in each of the hues connecting\nadjacent pairs of the six spectrum colors as represented on the\noriginal Plates of this work; together with an equal number of exact\nintermediates (not shown on the Plates), the latter in lower-case type\nand not indicated by symbols.\n\n  Number.

This originated in the\nfact that there seems to be no substance (pigment, dye, or fabric)\nwhich represents a true black, all reflecting more or less of white\nlight, and consequently producing shades which are dull or broken.\nThe difficulty is increased by the additional fact that any black\npigment mixed with almost any color falls short of even the color-wheel\nmixture in purity of hue in the resulting shades, owing to the very\nconsiderable amount of gray in all black pigments. Chromolithography\ncan be made to produce clearer and better shades of the pure colors,\nbut is distinctly objectionable for the purpose of a work of this\nkind owing to eventual oxidation of the oil or varnish with which the\npigments are combined in lithographic inks, causing a change of hue;\nreds becoming more orange, blues more greenish, etc., in course of time.\n\nWhile the absence (in large part) of pure chromatic shades is much\nto be regretted, the defect is not so serious, _from the standpoint\nof utility_, as might appear at first sight; for while saturated or\ndarkened pure colors are not uncommon in the animal, vegetable, and\nmineral kingdoms, more or less broken dark colors are infinitely more\nso; and since the latter are greatly increased in number by the defect\nmentioned the actual result is rather an advantage than otherwise.\n\nIt will doubtless be noticed that there is a conspicuous difference\nin relative darkness between shades of yellow and contiguous hues on\nthe one hand and corresponding ones of violet and adjacent hues on the\nother, as if the percentage of black in each were very different. This,\nhowever, is entirely the result of difference of luminosity of the\ntwo sets of colors, that of yellow being between 7000 and 8000 while\nthat of violet is only about 13;[28] for the percentage of black in\ncorresponding tones of the vertical scales is precisely the same for\neach color throughout the chromatic scale of this work.\n\n\n\n\nTABLE SHOWING PERCENTAGES OF NEUTRAL GRAY IN THE BROKEN COLOR SCALES.\n\n\nEvery Plate in each series of broken colors (′ to ′′′′′) contains\nexactly the same percentage of neutral gray in each color, the relative\namount increasing progressively in the several series, as shown in the\nfollowing table. The percentages of white in the tints and of black in\nthe shades of the tone scales are in all cases exactly the same as in\nthe tone scales of pure colors.\n\n     SERIES.

(The best substitute among pigments\nis a fine quality of _zinc yellow_, as Hatfield\'s.)\n\n=Hues between yellow and green.=—_Auramin_ washed with _light green_.\n\n=Green.=—_Auramin_ (very dilute) washed with _light green_. (The\nauramin should be applied first, because it \"sets\" or becomes fast\nquickly, while the light green does not, but is largely removed by\noverwashes of the yellow, thus rendering it very difficult to get the\ndesired hue.)\n\n=Hues between green and blue.=—_Methyl green_; the same washed with\n_light blue_ (Diamond Dye); for the hues nearer blue, _light blue_\nwashed with Winsor and Newton\'s _permanent blue_ or _new blue_ (the\nleast violet-hued of the artificial ultramarines).\n\n=Blue.=—_Light blue_ washed with _permanent blue_ or _new blue_.\n(Although the color is nearer that of the artificial ultramarines\nnamed, it is useless to apply the latter first, for overwashes of the\nlight blue merely sink through and darken the color without improving\nthe hue. A moderately saturated solution of the light blue should be\napplied first, and when this is dry covered with one or more rather\nthin washes of the permanent blue or new blue).\n\n=Hues between blue and violet.=—Winsor and Newton\'s _permanent blue_\nand some of the more violet-hued artificial ultramarines, the hues\nnearer violet washed with _crystal violet_ or _gentian violet_.\n\n=Violet.=—_Crystal violet._\n\n=Hues between violet and red.=—_Methyl violet 1b._ washed with\n_rhodamin b._; for hues nearer red, _rhodamin b._ with Devoe\'s\n_geranium red_ (dry) or _crocein scarlet b._\n\nWhile more or less similar in hue to rhodamin b., several other aniline\ndyes, as _acid fuchsin_, _rubin s._, _rosein_, _magenta_, etc., do not\ncombine satisfactorily with the violets, the mixture soon becoming dark\nor dull and none of them are quite as pure a purple or red-violet.\n\nIt is most important to remember that disks thus colored must be\ncarefully protected from light when not in actual use and _never_\nexposed to direct sunlight. The artificial ultramarines are, of course,\npermanent, and so, practically, are crocein scarlet, gold orange,\norange g., and auramin—that is to say, are not materially affected\nby the action of light except after very prolonged exposure, though\nthe last named undergoes a change of hue; but the green and violet\naniline dyes are all very evanescent, rapidly fading and eventually\ndisappearing; light blue and rhodamin, while sensitive to light, are\nfar less so than the greens and violets.\n\n\n\n\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF COLORS REPRESENTED ON PLATES OF THIS WORK\n\n\n   COLOR NAME.

Larger disks\nof spectrum red, green, and violet are interlocked and adjusted so\nthat they present, respectively, 32, 42, and 26 per cent. of the\ncircumference; superimposed on these is a single smaller disk of\nneutral gray, and on this two still smaller disks of black and white,\nthe former occupying 79, the latter 21, per cent. of the area. The\nresult of this combination of colors, when the disks are rapidly\nrevolved, is that the entire surface becomes a uniform neutral gray\nprecisely like the middle disk, which blends so completely with the\ncolor inside and outside its limits that no trace of division can be\ndetected. Hence, neutral gray equals a combination of red 32, green\n42, and violet 26 per cent., and also equals a combination of black\n79 and white 21 per cent. As further illustrating the point, it may\nbe mentioned that not only does the above-mentioned combination\nof the three primary colors equal neutral gray but so also does\nthe combination of any color (\"secondary\" or \"tertiary\" as well as\nprimary) with its complementary, though the darkness or lightness\nof the gray varies somewhat, as the following table shows:\n\n  Spectrum Color.

The following table, showing the average, mean,\nand extreme wave-length of each of the spectrum colors as given by\nnine or more authorities together with those of the present work (as\ndetermined by Dr. P. G. Nutting, Associate Physicist of the U. S.\nBureau of Standards) is of interest in this connection:\n\n                           Average        Extremes          Mean\n            This work.     of 9-12         of 9-12         of 9-12\n                         authorities.    authorities.    authorities.\n\n  Red        644            6770          6440-7028        6734 (10)\n  Orange     598 ± 2        6074          5892-6300        6096 (9)\n  Yellow     577 ± 1        5786          5640-5850        5745 (10)\n  Green      520 ± 10       5235          5050-5335        5193 (11)\n  Blue       473 ± 3        4738          4520-4861        4680 (12)\n  Violet     410            4176          4050-4330        4190 (10)\n\nFrom this table it will be seen that the red of this work is\nappreciably more orange than that of others, the orange slightly more\nyellowish, and the violet a little less bluish than the average;\nbut the author is assured by Dr. Nutting that these standards are\nexceptionally accurate.\n\n[13] The percentages are given in tables on pages 23 and 25.\n\n[14] That is to say, theoretically. Unfortunately it seems to be beyond\nthe colorists\' skill to reproduce true shades of the pure colors, all\nshowing a more or less decided admixture of gray, resulting in a series\nof broken or dull shades. (See pages 23 and 24.)\n\n[15] Although only 1115 different colors are actually shown on\nthe plates the system is really equivalent to the presentation of\nconsiderably more than 4000 distinguishable and designatable colors.\n\n[16] The Theory of Color (American edition, 1876), p. 99.\n\n[17] In the present work the possibility of variation between\ndifferent copies is wholly eliminated by a very different process of\nreproduction. Each color, for the entire edition, is painted uniformly\non large sheets of paper from a single mixture of pigments, these\nsheets being then cut into the small squares which represent the colors\non the plates.\n\n[18] See Rood: Modern Chromatics, pages 50-52.\n\n[19] Some criticisms of Popular Color Definitions and Suggestions for\na better Color Nomenclature. Milton Bradley Co., Springfield, Mass.\n(Small pamphlet of 15 pages).\n\n[20] Milton Bradley: Elementary Color, p. 25.\n\n[21] Exception has been taken in a recent work (\"A Color Notation,\"\nby A. H. Munsell) to the use of the term tone in this connection, on\nthe ground that its proper use belongs to music, and the term _value_\nis substituted. The same line of reasoning would, however, certainly\nrequire the discarding of _chromatic scale_ as a term of music\nnomenclature, since its derivation is clearly from color (chroma).\nFurthermore, the word \"value\" is even more elastic in its application\nthan tone, and, all things considered, the present writer, at least,\nfails to see that any improvement is made by the proposed change.\n\n[22] The term _chromatic scale_ has unfortunately been appropriated for\na very different use (in music); nevertheless it is strictly correct\nin the present sense while in the other it is not, though firmly\nestablished by long usage. The term _spectrum scale_ is not adequate,\nas a substitute, because the spectrum series of colors is incomplete\nthrough absence of the hues connecting violet with red, which are\nnecessary to show the full scale of pure colors and hues.\n\n[23] The distinctions of color or hue diminishing in proportion to the\nincreased admixture of gray, each alternate color or hue, with its\nscale (vertical) of tones, is omitted from the third and fourth series;\nwhile in the fifth the color differentiation is so greatly reduced that\nonly the six spectrum colors (dulled by admixture of 95.5 per cent. of\nneutral gray), together with purple (the intermediate between violet\nand red) are given; a yellow orange hue being substituted for spectrum\norange because it is more exactly intermediate in hue between red and\nyellow.\n\n[24] J. J. Müller found that a mixture of the orange and violet rays\nof the spectrum produced a whitish red (Rood, \"Modern Chromatics,\" p.\n129). The author of the present work, without being at the time aware\nof this, produced an absolutely pure red (but of reduced intensity)\nby mixture of either orange and violet (orange 63.5, violet 36.5 per\ncent. = red 85 + white 15 per cent.), or from orange and the violet-red\nwhich is complementary to green (violet-red 51, orange 49 per cent.),\nthe latter equaling red 89 + white 11 per cent; the mixtures being made\non a color-wheel with Maxwell disks representing the pure colors of the\npresent work. The red resulting from either of these mixtures on the\ncolor-wheel is far purer than the blue resulting from mixture of green\nand violet, and incomparably more so than the yellow resulting from\nmixture of either red and green or orange and green. Consequently, if\nthe same results would come from mixing orange and violet light, it is\ndifficult to understand how red can be a primary color _according to\nthe accepted definition_.\n\n[25] Rood: Modern Chromatics, p. 34.\n\nWith the single exception of Vanderpoel (Color Problems, p. 28,\nplates 3, 4, where yellow is given first in order of luminosity) all\nauthorities on color-physics that I have been able to consult very\nsingularly ignore yellow entirely in their treatment of the subject of\nluminosity.\n\n[26] All quotations here are from Milton Bradley\'s \"Elementary Color,\"\nexcept where otherwise noted.\n\n[27] As determined by Dr. P. G. Nutting, Associate Physicist, U. S.\nBureau of Standards.\n\n[28] See Rood, Modern Chromatics, pages 34, 35.\n\n[29] The aniline or coal-tar dyes named are all of the manufacture of\nDr. G. Grübler and Co., Leipzig, Germany, unless otherwise stated. (See\nPreface, page ii.)\n\n\n\n\nCAUTION!!!\n\nDO NOT EXPOSE THESE PLATES TO THE LIGHT FOR A LONGER TIME THAN IS\nNECESSARY.\n\n\nThe pigments used in the preparation of these Plates are the most\ndurable known, those which have been proven unstable having been, as\nfar as possible, discarded. The latter include carmine and other\ncochineal lakes, colors of vegetable origin (as gamboge, violet\ncarmine, indigo, etc.), and most of the aniline or coal tar dyes,\nthough among the last are a considerable number which are really more\npermanent than several colors habitually used by artists. Certain\ncolors in this work could not, however, possibly be reproduced except\nby the employment of pigments which are more or less sensitive to\n_prolonged exposure_ to light, and hence this caution not to expose the\nplates unnecessarily.\n\n(See _Church_: \"The Chemistry of Paints and Painting,\" third edition,\npages 257-263.)\n\n\n\n\n_Plate I_\n\n\n     1 RED                      3 O-R.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n',1),(2,'The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Marquis de Villemer, by George Sand\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

God does not abandon\nthose who depend upon him, and who do their best to second his tender\nprovidence. What has been saddest for me in my resolution are your\ntears,--yours and the dear little ones\'; it is hard for me to restrain\nmine when I think of them; but you _must_ see it was absolutely\nnecessary. I could not sit with folded hands when you have four children\nto rear. Since I have courage and health, and no other claim upon me in\nthis world than that of my tenderness for you and for those poor angels,\nit was for me to go forth and try to gain our livelihood. I will reach\nthat end, be sure. Sustain me instead of regretting me and making me\nweaker; that is all I ask of you. And with this, my much-loved sister, I\nembrace you and our dear children with all my heart. Do not make them\nweep by speaking to them of me; but try, nevertheless, not to let them\nforget me; that would pain me beyond measure.\n\nCAROLINE DE SAINT-GENEIX.\n\nJanuary 3, 1845.\n\n\nSECOND LETTER.--TO THE SAME.\n\n\nVictory, great victory! my good sister. I have just returned from our\ngreat lady\'s, and--success unhoped for, as you shall see. Since I have\none more evening of liberty, and that probably the last, I am going to\nprofit by it in giving you an account of the interview. It will seem as\nif I were chatting with you again at the fireside, rocking Charley with\none hand and amusing Lili with the other. Dear loves, what are they\ndoing at this moment? They do not imagine that I am all alone in a\nmelancholy room of a public house, for, in the fear of being troublesome\nto Madame d\'Arglade, I put up at a little hotel; but I shall be very\ncomfortable at the Marchioness\'s, and this lone evening is not a bad one\nfor me to collect myself and think of you without interruption. I did\nwell, besides, not to count too much upon the hospitality which was\noffered me, because Madame d\'Arglade is absent, and so I had to\nintroduce myself to Madame de Villemer.\n\nYou asked me to give you a description of her: she is about sixty years\nold, but she is infirm and seldom leaves her arm-chair; that and her\nsuffering face make her look fifteen years older. She could never have\nbeen beautiful, or comely of form; yet her countenance is expressive and\nhas a character of its own. She is very dark; her eyes are magnificent,\njust a little hard, but frank. Her nose is straight and too nearly\napproaches her mouth, which is not at all handsome. Her mouth is\nordinarily scornful; still, her whole face gleams and mellows with a\nhuman sympathy when she smiles, and she smiles readily. My first\nimpression agrees with my last. I believe this woman very good by\nprinciple rather than by impulse, and courageous rather than cheerful.\nShe has intelligence and cultivation. In fine, she does not differ much\nfrom the description which Madame d\'Arglade gave us of her.\n\nShe was alone when I was conducted into her apartment. Gracefully enough\nshe made me sit down close to her, and here is a report of our\nconversation:--\n\n\"You have been highly recommended to me by Madame d\'Arglade, whom I\nesteem very much indeed. I know that you belong to an excellent family,\nthat you have talents and an honorable character, and that your life has\nbeen blameless. I have therefore the greatest wish that we may\nunderstand each other and agree. For that, there must be two things: one\nthat my offer may seem satisfactory to you; the other that our views may\nnot be too much opposed, as that would be the source of frequent\nmisunderstandings. Let us deal with the first question. I offer you\ntwelve hundred francs a year.\"\n\n\"So I have been told, Madame, and I have accepted.\"\n\n\"Have I not been told, too, that you would perhaps find that\ninsufficient?\"\n\n\"It is true, that is little for the needs of my situation; but Madame is\nthe judge of her own affairs, and since I am here--\"\n\n\"Speak frankly; you think that is not enough?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that. It is probably more than my services are worth.\"\n\n\"I am far from saying so, and you--you say it from modesty; but you fear\nthat will not be enough to keep you? Do not let it trouble you; I will\ntake everything upon myself; you will have no expense here except for\nyour toilet, and in that regard I make no requirement. And do you love\ndress?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, very much; but I shall abstain from it, because in that\nmatter you make no requirement.\"\n\nThe sincerity of my answer appeared to astonish the Marchioness. Perhaps\nI ought not to have spoken without restraint, as it is my habit to do.\nShe took a little time to collect herself. Finally she began to smile\nand said, \"Ah, so! why do you love dress? You are young, pretty, and\npoor; you have neither the need nor the right to bedizen yourself?\"\n\n\"I have so little right to do it,\" I answered, \"that I go simply clad,\nas you see.\"\n\n\"That is very well, but you are troubled because your toilet is not more\nelegant?\"\n\n\"No, Madame, I am not troubled about it at all, since it must be so. I\nsee that I spoke without reflection when I told you that I was fond of\ndress, and that has given you a poor idea of my understanding. I pray\nyou to see nothing in that avowal but the effect of my sincerity. You\nquestioned me concerning my tastes, and I answered as if I had the honor\nto be known to you; it was perhaps an impropriety, and I beg you to\npardon it.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" rejoined she, \"if I knew you, I would be aware that\nyou accept the necessities of your position without ill-temper and\nwithout murmuring?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, that is it exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, your impropriety, if it is one at all, is far from displeasing\nme. I love sincerity above all things; I love it perhaps more than I do\nunderstanding, and I make an appeal to your entire frankness. Now what\nwas it that persuaded you to accept such slight remuneration for coming\nhere and keeping company with an infirm and perhaps tiresome old woman?\"\n\n\"In the first place, Madame, I have been told that you are very\nintelligent and kind, and on that account I did not expect to find life\ntiresome with you; and then, even if I should have to endure a great\ndeal, it is my duty to accept it all rather than to remain idle. My\nfather having left us no fortune, my sister was at least well enough\nmarried, and I felt no scruples in living with her; but her husband, who\nhad nothing but the salary of his place, recently died after a long and\ncruel illness, which had absorbed all our little savings. It therefore\nnaturally falls upon me to support my sister and her four children.\"\n\n\"With twelve hundred francs!\" cried the Marchioness. \"No, that cannot\nbe. Ah! Madame d\'Arglade did not tell me that. She, without doubt,\nfeared the distrust which misfortune inspires; but she was very much\nmistaken in my case; your self-devotion interests me, and, if we can\nagree in other respects, I hope to make you sensible of my regard. Trust\nin me; I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Ah! Madame,\" I replied, \"whether I have the good fortune to suit you or\nnot, let me thank you for this good prompting of your heart.\" And I\nkissed her hand impulsively, at which she did not seem displeased.\n\n\"Yet,\" continued she, after another silence, in which she appeared to\ndistrust her own suggestion, \"what if you are slightly frivolous and a\nlittle of a coquette.\"\n\n\"I am neither the one nor the other.\"\n\n\"I hope not. Yet you are very pretty. They did not tell me that either,\nand the more I look at you, the more I think you are even remarkably\npretty. That troubles me a little, and I do not conceal it from you.\"\n\n\"Why, Madame?\"\n\n\"Why? Yes, you are right. The ugly believe themselves beautiful, and to\nthe desire to please they add the faculty of making themselves\nridiculous. You would better perhaps have the art of pleasing,--provided\nyou do not abuse it. Well now, are you good enough girl and strong\nenough woman to give me a little account of your past life? Have you had\nsome romance? Yes, you have,--have n\'t you? It is impossible that it\ncould have been otherwise? You are twenty-two or twenty-three years\nold--\"\n\n\"I am twenty-four, and I have had no other romance than the one of which\nI am going to tell you in two words. At seventeen I was sought in\nmarriage by a person who pleased me, and who withdrew when he learned\nthat my father had left more debts than capital. I was very much\ngrieved, but I have forgotten it all, and I have sworn never to marry.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is spite, and not forgetfulness.\"\n\n\"No, Madame, that was an effort of the reason. Having nothing, but\nbelieving myself to be something, I did not wish to make a foolish\nmarriage; and, far from having any spite, I have forgiven him who\nabandoned me. I forgave him especially the day when, seeing my sister\nand her four children in misery, I understood the sorrow of the father\nof a family who dies with the pain of knowing that he can leave nothing\nto his orphans.\"\n\n\"And you saw that ingrate again?\"\n\n\"No, never. He is married, and I have ceased to think of him.\"\n\n\"And since then you have never thought of any other?\"\n\n\"No, Madame.\"\n\n\"How have you done?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I believe I have not had time to think of myself. When\none is very poor, and does not want to give up to misery, the days are\nwell filled out.\"\n\n\"But you have, nevertheless, been much sought after, pretty as you\nare,--have you not?\"\n\n\"No, Madame, no one has troubled me in that way. I do not believe in\npersecutions which are not at all encouraged.\"\n\n\"I think as you do, and I am satisfied with your manner of answering. Do\nyou, then, fear nothing for yourself in the future?\"\n\n\"I fear nothing at all.\"\n\n\"And will not this solitude of the heart make you sad or sullen?\"\n\n\"I do not foresee it in any way. I am naturally cheerful, and I have\npreserved my command over myself in the midst of the most cruel tests. I\nhave no dream of love in my head; I am not romantic. If I ever change I\nshall be very much astonished. That, Madame, is all I can tell you about\nmyself. Will you take me such as I represent myself with confidence,\nsince I can after all but give myself out for what I know myself to be?\"\n\n\"Yes, I take you for what you are,--an excellent young woman, full of\nfrankness and good-will. It remains to be seen whether you really have\nthe little attainments that I require.\"\n\n\"What must I do?\"\n\n\"Talk, in the first place; and upon that point I am already satisfied.\nAnd then you must read, and play a little music.\"\n\n\"Try me right away; and if the little I can do suits you--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, putting a book into my hands, \"do read; I want to\nbe enchanted with you.\"\n\nAt the end of a page she took the book away from me, with the remark\nthat my reading was perfect. Then came the music. There was a piano in\nthe room. She asked me if I could read at sight. As that is about all I\ncan do, I could satisfy her again on that point. Finally she told me\nthat, knowing my writing and my style of composition, from letters of\nmine which Madame d\'Arglade had shown her, she considered that I would\nbe an excellent secretary, and she dismissed me, giving me her hand, and\nsaying many kind things to me. I asked her for one day--to-morrow--in\norder to see some people here with whom we are acquainted, and she has\ngiven orders that I should be installed Saturday.--\n\nDear sister, I have just been interrupted. What a pleasant surprise! It\nis a note from Madame de Villemer,--a note of three lines, which I\ntranscribe for you:--\n\n\"Permit me, dear child, to send you a trifle on account, for your\nsister\'s children, and a little dress for yourself. As you are fond of\ndress we must humor the weaknesses of those we like. It is arranged and\nunderstood that you are to have a hundred and fifty francs a month, and\nthat I take upon myself to keep you in clothes.\"\n\nHow good and motherly that is,--is it not? I see that I shall love that\nwoman with all my heart, and that I had not estimated her, at first\nsight, as highly as she deserved. She is more impulsive than I thought.\nThe five hundred franc bill I enclose in this letter. Make haste! some\nwood in the cellar, some woollen petticoats for Lili, who needs them,\nand a chicken from time to time on that poor table. A little wine for\nyou; your stomach is quite shattered, and it will take so little to\nrestore it. The chimney must be repaired; it smokes atrociously: it is\nunbearable; it may weaken the children\'s eyes,--and those of my little\ngirl are so beautiful!\n\nReally, I am ashamed of the dress which is intended for me,--a dress of\nmagnificent pearl-gray silk. Ah, how foolish I was to say that I liked\nto be well dressed! A dress for forty francs would have satisfied my\nambition, and here I am attired in one worth two hundred, while my poor\nsister is repairing her rags. I do not know where to hide myself; but do\nnot at least think that I am humiliated by receiving a present. I shall\nrelieve my conscience of the burden of these kindnesses, my heart tells\nme. You see, Camille, everything succeeds with me as soon as I enter\nupon it. I light, the first thing, upon an excellent woman, I get more\nthan I had agreed to take, and I am received and treated as a child whom\nit is desired to adopt and spoil. And then to think that you kept me\nback a whole six months, imposing an increase of privations upon\nyourself and tearing your hair at the idea of my working for you! Good\nsister, were you not then a bad mother? Ought not those dear treasures\nof children to have been considered above all things, and should they\nnot have silenced even our own regard for each other? Ah! I was very\nmuch afraid of failure, nevertheless, I will confess to you now, when I\ntook out of the house our last few louis for the expenses of my journey,\nat the risk of returning without having pleased this lady. God has been\nconcerned in it, Camille; I prayed to him this morning with such\nconfidence! I asked him so fervently to make me amiable, decorous, and\npersuasive. Now I am going to bed, for I am overcome with fatigue. I\nlove you, my little sister, you know, more than anything else in the\nworld, and much more than myself. Do not grieve about me then; I am just\nnow the happiest girl that lives, and yet I am not with you and do not\nsee our children as they sleep! You see, indeed, that there is no true\nhappiness in selfishness, since, alone as I am, separated from all that\nI love, my heart beats with joy in spite of my tears, and I am going to\nthank God upon my knees before I fall asleep.\n\nCAROLINE.\n\n\nWhile Mlle de Saint-Geneix was writing to her sister, the Marchioness de\nVillemer was talking with the youngest of her sons in her little\ndrawing-room in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The house was large and\nrespectable; yet the Marchioness, formerly rich and now in very narrow\ncircumstances,--we shall soon see why,--had of late occupied the second\nfloor in order to turn the first to account.\n\n\"Well, dear mother,\" said the Marquis, \"are you satisfied with your new\ncompanion? Your people have told me that she has arrived.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered the Marchioness, \"I have but one word to say\nof her, and that is that she has bewitched me.\"\n\n\"Really? Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I am not too sure that I dare. I am afraid of turning\nyour head in advance.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" was the sorrowful reply of the Marquis, whom his mother\nhad tried to win into a smile; \"even if I were so easy to inflame, I\nknow too well what I owe to the dignity of your house and to the repose\nof your life.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my friend; I know too that I can be at ease upon a question\nof honor and delicacy, when it is with you that I have to do; I can also\ntell you that the little D\'Arglade has found for me a pearl, a diamond,\nand that, to commence with, this phoenix has led me into follies.\"\n\nThe Marchioness gave an account of her interview with Caroline, and\ndescribed her thus: \"She is neither tall nor short, she is well formed,\nhas pretty little feet, the hands of a child, abundant light blond hair,\na complexion of lilies and roses, perfect features, pearly teeth, a\ndecided little nose, large sea-green eyes, which look straight at you\nunflinchingly, without dreaminess, without false timidity, with a candor\nand a confidence which please and engage; nothing of a provincial, she\nhas manners which are excellent because they do not seem to be manners\nat all; much taste and gentility in the poverty of her attire; in a\nword, all that I feared and yet nothing that I feared, that is, beauty\nwhich inspired me with distrust and none of the affectations and\npretensions which would have justified that distrust; and more, a voice\nand pronunciation which make real music of her reading, sterling talent\nas a musician, and, above all that, every indication of mind, sense,\ndiscretion, and good-nature: to such an extent that, interested and\ncarried away by her devotion to a poor family to which I see plainly she\nis sacrificing herself, I forgot my projects of economy, and have\nengaged to give her the eyes out of my head.\"\n\n\"Has she been bargaining with you?\" demanded the Marquis.\n\n\"Quite the contrary, she was satisfied to take what I had determined to\ngive her.\"\n\n\"In that case you did well, mother, and I am glad that you have at last\na companion worthy of you. You have kept too long that hungry and sleepy\nold maid who worried you, and when you have a chance to replace her by a\ntreasure, you would do very wrong to count the cost.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Marchioness, \"that\'s what your brother also says;\nneither he nor you care to count the cost, my dear children, and I fear\nI have been too hasty in the satisfaction which I have just given\nmyself.\"\n\n\"That satisfaction was necessary to you,\" said the Marquis with spirit,\n\"and you ought the less to reproach yourself with it since you have\nyielded to your need of performing a good action.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge it, but I was wrong perhaps,\" replied the Marchioness,\nwith a careworn expression; \"one has not always the right to be\ncharitable.\"\n\n\"Ah! my mother,\" cried the son, with a mingling of indignation and\nsadness, \"when you are forced to deny yourself the joy of giving alms,\nthe injury that I have done will be very great!\"\n\n\"The injury! you? what injury?\" rejoined the mother, astonished and\ntroubled; \"you have never done an injury, my dear son.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Marquis, greatly moved. \"I was to blame the day I\nengaged, out of respect to you, to pay my brother\'s debts.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" cried the Marchioness, turning pale. \"Let us not speak of that,\nwe would not understand each other.\" She extended her hands to the\nMarquis to lessen the involuntary bitterness of this answer. The Marquis\nkissed his mother\'s hands and retired shortly afterward.\n\nThe next day, Caroline de Saint-Geneix went out to mail with her own\nhands the registered letter which she sent to her sister, and to see\nsome people from the remotest part of her province with whom she kept up\nher acquaintance. These were old friends of her family, whom she did not\nsucceed in meeting, and she left her name without giving her address, as\nshe no longer had a home which she could consider her own. She felt a\nspecies of sadness to think of herself thus lost and dependent in a\nstrange house; but she did not indulge in long reflections upon her\ndestiny. In addition to the fact that she refused once for all to\nnourish in herself the least unnerving melancholy, she was not at all a\ntimid character, and any test, howsoever unpleasant, did not set her at\nvariance with life. There was in her organization an astonishing\nvitality, an ardent activity, which was all the more remarkable because\nit arose from great tranquillity of mind and from a singular absence of\nthought about herself. This character, which is exceptional enough, will\ndevelop and explain itself as much as we can make it do so, by the\nevents of the following narrative; but the reader must necessarily\nremember, what all the world knows, that no one can explain completely\nand set in an exact light the character of another. Every individual has\nin the depth of his being a mystery of power or of weakness which he\nhimself can as little reveal as he can understand. Analysis should seem\nsatisfactory when it comes near to truth, but it could not seize the\ntruth in the fact without leaving some phase of the eternal problem of\nthe soul incomplete or obscure.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIt was with a mingled feeling of sadness and joy that Caroline,\nsometimes on foot and sometimes in an omnibus, traversed all alone the\ngreat city of Paris, where she had been reared in ease, and which she\nhad left ruined and broken as to her future, in the very flower of her\nlife. Let us recount in a few words, once for all, the grave, yet simple\nevents of which she has given some outlines to the Marchioness de\nVillemer.\n\nShe was the daughter of a gentleman of Lower Brittany, settled in the\nneighborhood of Blois, and of a Mlle de Grajac, a native of Velay.\nCaroline hardly knew her mother. Madame de Saint-Geneix died the third\nyear of her marriage in giving birth to Camille, having exacted a\npromise from Justine Lanion to spend several years with the motherless\nchildren.\n\nJustine Lanion--Peyraque, by marriage--was a robust and honest\npeasant-woman of Velay, who consented to remain eight years with M. de\nSaint-Geneix. She had been Caroline\'s nurse, and had afterward returned\nto her own family, whence she was soon called back to give the milk of\nher second child to the second daughter of her \"dear lady.\" Thanks to\nthis faithful creature, Caroline and Camille knew the care and\ntenderness of a second mother; still, Justine could not forget her\nhusband and her own children. She had, at last, to return to her\nprovince, and M. de Saint-Geneix took his daughters to Paris, where they\nwere brought up in one of the convents then in fashion.\n\nAs he was not rich enough to live in Paris, he rented temporary\napartments there, to which he went twice a year for the Easter Holidays\nand his daughters\' vacations. These were also the worthy man\'s\nvacations. He practised economy the rest of the year that he might\nrefuse nothing to his children in those days of patriarchal\nmerry-making. Then their time was absorbed wholly in strolls, concerts,\nvisiting the museums, excursions to the royal palaces or dinners,\nruinous in their expense,--veritable pleasurings of a life, full of\nsimple, paternal affection, indeed, but as imprudent as it well could\nbe. The good man idolized his daughters, who were both very beautiful\nand as good as they were beautiful. It was a pleasant fancy with him to\nsee them going out for a walk, dressed with perfect taste, looking\nfresher than their dresses and ribbons new from the shop; to display\ntheir beauty in the light and sunshine of Paris, that brilliant city,\nwhere he had few acquaintances, to be sure, but where the slightest\nnotice of some casual passer-by seemed more important than any amount of\nprovincial admiration. To make Parisians, real Parisian ladies, of these\ntwo charming girls was the dream of his life. He would have spent his\nwhole fortune to accomplish this; and--he did so spend it.\n\nThis infatuated desire to taste the delights of life in Paris is a\nspecies of fatality which had, a few years ago, taken possession not\nonly of the well-to-do people of the provinces, but of whole classes.\nEvery great foreign nobleman, also, howsoever little his cultivation,\nrushed wildly to Paris, like a school-boy in vacation time, tore himself\naway from its attractions with bitter regret, and passed the rest of the\nyear at home in devising measures to obtain the passport giving him\nleave to return. Even to-day, if it were not for the severity of laws\nwhich condemn Russians to Russia, and Poles to Poland, immense fortunes\nwould vie with one another in their eagerness to come and be swallowed\nup in the pleasures of Paris.\n\nThe two young ladies each profited very differently by their elegant\neducation. Camille, the younger and the prettier of the two,--which is\nsaying a great deal,--entered heartily into the giddy tastes of her\nfather, whom she resembled in face and in character. She was\npassionately fond of luxury, and it had never occurred to her that her\nlife could ever become unhappy. Mild and loving, but not very\nintelligent, she became merely an accomplished young lady in the matters\nof style, dress, and manners. Returning to the convent at the close of\nher vacations, she passed three months languishing regretfully, the next\nthree working a little in order to please her sister, who would\notherwise find fault with her; and the rest of the term in dreaming\nabout her father\'s return and the pleasures it would bring.\n\nCaroline, on the other hand, was more like her mother, who had been a\nwoman of seriousness and energy. Yet she was usually cheerful, and more\ndemonstrative even than her sister in the hearty enjoyment of their\nfreedom. She showed herself more eager to make the most of dress, of\ntheir walks and their sightseeing, but she relished all in a different\nway. She was far more intellectual than Camille, with no creative genius\nfor Art indeed, but yet deeply sensitive to all its true manifestations.\nShe was born appreciative; that is, she could express the unspoken\nthought of another with brilliancy and refinement. She repeated poetry\nor read music with a surprising mastery of both. She spoke little, but\nalways well, yet with a strange precision, as if her ideas were all\ndrawn from within. But whenever she received suggestions from outside\nsources,--from books, music, or the stage,--she gave the written thought\na new radiance. She seemed to be the necessary instrument of genius;\nwithin the limits of interpretation, this gift of hers might have been\ngenius itself, had it received its full development.\n\nBut this it never received. Caroline had commenced her education at ten\nyears of age; at seventeen it was wholly broken off. This is the way it\nhappened: M. de Saint-Geneix having an income of only twelve thousand\nfrancs, and yet dreaming of a future for his daughters worthy of their\nattractions, had entangled himself with pitiable ingenuousness in\nspeculations which were to quadruple his property, and which engulfed it\nin instant ruin.\n\nVery pale, and as if dazed by some powerful shock, he came one day to\nParis for his daughters. He took them to his little manor-house with no\nexplanation whatever, and complaining only of a slight fever. He lay\nthere ill for three months, and then died of grief, confessing his ruin\nto his two future sons-in-law; for at the appearance of the young ladies\nat Blois, many suitors presented themselves, and two of them had been\naccepted.\n\nThe gentleman betrothed to Camille was a civil officer, a respectable\nman, who was sincerely fond of her, and married her in spite of\neverything. Caroline was engaged to a gentleman of property. He reasoned\nmore selfishly, plead the opposition of his family, and withdrew his\npretensions. Caroline was brave. Her weaker sister would have died of\ngrief; but she was not the one deserted. Weakness exacts respect oftener\nthan energy. Moral courage is something invisible, and it breaks down\nsilently. Killing a soul too leaves no trace. Therefore the strong are\nalways buffeted, and the weak are buoyed up always.\n\nFortunately for Caroline, her love had not been intense. Her heart,\nwhich was naturally affectionate, had begun to feel some confidence and\nsympathy; but the mysterious grief and the increasing illness of her\nfather very soon took such strong possession of her mind that she could\nnot permit herself to dwell much upon her own happiness. The love of a\nnoble young woman is a flower which opens in the sunshine of hope; but\nall hopefulness on her own account was overshadowed by the feeling that\nher father\'s life was swiftly gliding away. She saw in her betrothed\nonly a friend who would share with her the duty of weeping. Toward him\nshe felt gratitude and esteem; but grief stood in the way of elation and\nenthusiasm. Passion had not had time to blossom.\n\nCaroline was then rather bruised than broken by desertion. Her love for\nher father was so great, and she mourned him so deeply, that the ruin of\nher own future prospects seemed to her but a secondary grief. Though she\nwas not at all indignant, yet she was sensible of the injury, and while\nshe revenged herself only by forgetting, she preserved toward men a\ncertain vague resentment, which kept her from believing in love and from\nlistening to the flatteries addressed to her beauty up to the age at\nwhich we now find her, cured, courageous, and sincerely believing\nherself proof against all attraction.\n\nIt is unnecessary to recount the events of the years which we have just\nmade her pass over. All the world knows that the loss of a fortune,\nsmall or great, does not become an accomplished fact visibly from one\nday to the next. Settlements with creditors are attempted, a belief that\nsomething may be saved from the wreck is entertained, a series of\nuncertainties is passed through, of astonishments, hopes deferred, up to\nthe day when, seeing all efforts fruitless, the situation, good or bad,\nis finally accepted. Camille was prostrated by this disaster, in which,\nto the last moment, she refused to believe; but she was well married and\ndid not suffer any real hardship. Caroline, with more foresight, was\napparently less affected by the positive destitution which necessarily\nfell upon her. Her brother-in-law would not entertain the thought of\ntheir parting, and generously made her share the competence of his\nfamily; but she understood perfectly that her support was gone, and her\npride increased on that account. Feeling that her sister lacked activity\nand a sense of order, and seeing moreover that she would be subject from\nyear to year to the suffering and cares of maternity, Caroline became\nthe housekeeper, the nurse of the children, in short, the first\nmaid-servant of the little household, and into the austere duties of\nthis self-sacrifice she contrived to work so much grace, good sense, and\ncheerfulness, that all was pleasant around her and she rendered more\ngood offices than she received. Then came the illness of her\nbrother-in-law, his death, the discovery of old debts which he had\nconcealed, intending to pay them off, gradually and easily, out of his\nsalary; in short, the embarrassment, anxiety, and trouble of Camille,\nand, at last, the utter despondency and misery of the young widow.\n\nWe have seen that, for some time, Caroline had been hesitating between\nthe fear of leaving her sister alone and the desire to assist her by\nsome direct effort. There was, indeed, one wealthy gentleman, neither\nyoung nor very gracious, who considered her a model housewife, and made\nher an offer of marriage. Caroline felt, at first vaguely but afterwards\nwith sufficient clearness, that Camille wished her to sacrifice herself.\nShe then determined that she would indeed make the sacrifice, but in a\ndifferent way. She asked nothing better than to give up her freedom, her\nindependence, her time, her life; but to demand the offering up of\nherself, soul and body, to procure a little more comfort for the\nfamily,--this was too much. She pardoned in the mother her selfishness\nas a sister, and without appearing to see it, she decided upon the\ncourse which we have seen her take. She left Camille in a poor little\ncountry home, rented in the neighborhood of Blois, and set out for\nParis, where we know she was kindly welcomed by Madame de Villemer,\nwhose history we have now also briefly to relate.\n\nEvery family has its sore spot, every fortune its open wound out of\nwhich its life-blood and the very security of its existence may ebb\naway. The noble family of Villemer had its skeleton in the wild\nmisdoings of the eldest son of the Marchioness. The first husband of the\nMarchioness had been the Duke d\'Aléria, a haughty Spaniard, with a\nterrible disposition, who had made her as unhappy as she could be, but\nwho, after five stormy years, had left her an ample fortune, and a son\nhandsome, good-humored, and intelligent, though destined to become\nthoroughly sceptical, royally prodigal, and miserably profligate.\n\nHaving married the Marquis de Villemer, and becoming a mother and widow\nfor the second time, the Marchioness found in Urbain, her second son, a\ndevoted, generous friend, as austere in his habits as his brother was\ncorrupt, rich enough by his paternal inheritance to prevent him from\ngrieving too much about his mother\'s ruin; for, at the time when we\nbegin our history of these three people, the Marchioness had little or\nnothing left, thanks to the life which the young Duke had led.\n\nAt this period, the young Duke was a little over thirty-six years of\nage, and the Marquis nearly thirty-three. The Duchess d\'Aléria, as will\nbe seen, had lost little time in becoming the Marchioness de Villemer.\nNo one had blamed her for this. She was passionately attached to her\nsecond husband. It is even said that she had loved him as far as she\nmight, in all honor and innocence, before her first widowhood. The\nMarchioness had a generous nature and was somewhat excitable. And the\npremature death of this second husband made her almost insane for one or\ntwo years. She would not see any one, and even her own children became\nalmost like strangers to her. Seeing this, the relatives of both her\nlate husbands were disposed to set her aside and to take charge\nthemselves of the education of her sons; but, at this idea, the\nMarchioness came to her senses. Nature made a great effort; her soul\nrose above its sorrow, her motherly feeling awoke, and the passionate\ncrisis which made her cling to her two sons with tears and caresses,\nrestored her power of reasoning and the control of her will. She\nremained an invalid, weak and prematurely old, a little peculiar in some\nrespects, yet highly energetic in her conduct, exemplary in her\naffections, and truly noble in all her relations with the world. From\nthis time forth, she began to attract notice by the brightness of her\nmind, which had been for a long time asleep as it were in the midst of\nher sorrow and her love, but which now, at last, showed itself in the\nform of courage.\n\nWhat precedes has sufficiently established her position in this story.\nWe will now leave Caroline de Saint-Geneix to estimate as she\nunderstands them the Marchioness and her two sons.\n\n\nLETTER TO MADAME CAMILLE HEUDEBERT.\n\nParis, March 15, 1845.\n\nYes, dear little sister, I am very well settled, as I have told you in\nmy preceding letters. I have a pretty room, a good fire, a fine\ncarriage, servants, and a well-furnished table. I have only to believe\nmyself rich and a Marchioness, since, scarcely ever out of the presence\nof my old lady, I am necessarily a sharer in all the comforts of her\nlife.\n\nBut you reproach me with writing very short letters. It is because, up\nto this time, I have had but a few moments to myself. In fact, the\nMarchioness, who, I believe, wished to put me a little to proof, appears\nnow to be satisfied that I am quite sincerely devoted to her, and she\npermits me to leave her at midnight. So I can chat with you without\nhaving to sit up till four o\'clock in the morning to do it, for the\nMarchioness receives till two, and she kept me an hour afterward to\ndiscuss the people whom we had just seen,--a task which, I will confess\nto you as I confessed to her, began to be very wearisome to me. She\nthought that I was, like her, a late riser. When she learned that I\nalways awoke at six o\'clock in the morning, and could not get asleep\nagain, she generously respected that \"provincial infirmity.\" So, morning\nor evening, I shall be hereafter at your service, dear Camille.\n\nYes, I love this old lady, and I love her a great deal. She has a great\ncharm for me, and the influence which she exercises over my mind comes\nespecially from the sincerity and purity of her own. She is not without\nprejudices, it is true, and she has many ideas which are not, and never\nwill be, mine; but she holds to these honestly, without anything like\nhypocritical subterfuge, and the antipathies which she expresses are not\nat all formidable; for even in her prepossessions her perfect integrity\nis manifest.\n\nAnd besides, during the three weeks in which I have seen the great\nworld,--since the Marchioness, without giving formal parties, receives\nquite a number of visits every evening,--I have become aware of a\ngeneral eclipse, of which, in the remoteness of my province, I never\nformed so complete an idea. I assure you that, with the best of manners\nand a certain air of superiority, people here are as nearly nonentities\nas they can possibly be. They no longer have opinions on anything; they\nfind fault with everything, and know the remedy for nothing. They speak\nill of everybody, and are nevertheless on the best terms with everybody.\nThere is no indignation about it, just merely scandal. They are always\npredicting the greatest catastrophes, and they seem to enjoy the most\nprofound security. In a word, they are as empty and shallow as\nfickleness, as weakness itself; and in the midst of these troubled\nspirits and of these threadbare convictions, I love this old\nMarchioness, so frank in her antipathies and so nobly inaccessible to\ncompromise. I seem to see a personage of another century, a sort of\nfemale Duke de Saint-Simon, guarding the respect of rank as a religion,\nand understanding nothing of the power of money against which feeble or\nhypocritical protests are made around her.\n\nAnd as far as I am concerned, you know the contempt of money goes a good\nway. Our misfortunes have not changed me, for I do not call by the name\nof money that sacred thing, the salary which I now earn here proudly and\neven with a little haughtiness. That is duty, a guaranty of honor.\nLuxury itself, when it is the continuation or the recompense of an\nelevated life, does not inspire me with the philosophic disdain which\nalways conceals a trifle of envy; but wealth coveted, hunted up and\ndown, bought at the price of ambitious marriages, by the unwinding of\npolitical conscience, by family intrigues about successions,--these are\nwhat justly wear the villanous name of money, and on that point I agree\nheartily with the Marchioness, who has no pardon for interested and\nill-suited marriages, and for all other insipid things, whether private\nor public.\n\nThat is why the Marchioness without regret and without dread sees all\nthat she possesses fall day by day into a gulf. I have already said\nsomething to you about that. I told you that the Duke d\'Aléria, her\nelder son, ruined her, while the younger, the Marquis, the son of her\nlast husband, came to her support with tender respect, and again placed\nher upon a very comfortable footing.\n\nI must now speak of these two gentlemen, of whom I have yet told you but\na few words. I have seen the Marquis from the first day of my\ninstallation here. Every morning from noon to one o\'clock, and every\nevening from eleven till midnight, he passes with his mother. Besides,\nhe dines with her quite frequently. I have therefore had time to observe\nhim, and I imagine that I already know him tolerably well. He is a young\nman who appears to me to have had no youth. His health is delicate, and\nhis mind, which is cultivated and elevated, is engaged in a struggle\nagainst some secret grief, or a natural tendency to sadness. He could\nnot have an external appearance less striking at first sight, and\nexciting more sympathy in proportion to the degree in which his face\nreveals itself. He is neither tall nor short, neither handsome nor\nhomely. There is nothing negligent or studied in his style of dress. He\nseems to have an instinctive aversion to everything which might draw\nattention to the person. Yet one sees very soon that he is no ordinary\nman. The few words which he says to you have a deep or delicate meaning,\nand his eyes, when they lose the perplexity of a certain shyness, are so\nhandsome, so good, so intelligent, that I do not believe I ever met\ntheir equals.\n\nHis conduct toward his mother is admirable and paints him at full\nlength. I saw him pay out several millions, all his personal fortune, to\ndischarge the rash debts of the elder son, and he never frowned, never\nsaid a word, never showed any vexation or regret. The weaker she was\ntoward this ungrateful and graceless son, the more tender and devoted\nand respectful was the Marquis. You see it is impossible not to esteem\nthis man, and, as for me, I feel a sort of veneration for him.\n\nHis conversation, too, is very agreeable. He scarcely speaks at all in\nsociety; but in intimacy, when the first reserve is worn off, he talks\ncharmingly. He is not only a cultivated man, he is a well of science. I\nbelieve he has read everything, for upon whatever subject you suggest,\nhe is interesting, and proves that he has sounded it to the bottom. His\nconversation is so necessary to his mother, that when anything prevents\nhis accustomed visit or lessens its duration, she is restless, and, as\nit were, out of her reckoning for the remainder of the day.\n\nAt first, as soon as I saw him come in the morning, I took it upon\nmyself to retire, and I did so the more readily, seeing that this\nsuperior and therefore excessively modest man appeared embarrassed by my\npresence. It was doing me great honor, to be sure; but at the end of\nthree or four days he had so far regained his tranquillity as to ask me\nvery kindly why he put me to flight. I should not have believed myself\nauthorised by that to restrain the confidential freedom of the son and\nmother; but she herself begged me to stay, even insisting upon it, and\nshe afterward gave me with her habitual frankness her reason for so\ndoing. And here is that reason, which is a little singular:--\n\n\"My son is of a melancholy spirit,\" she said; \"that, however, is not my\ncharacter. I am very much depressed or very animated, never dreamy, and\ndreaminess in others irritates me a little. In my son it troubles or\nafflicts me. I have never been able to resign myself to it. When we are\nalone together it requires constant effort on my part to keep him from\nfalling into his reveries. When we are surrounded by fifteen or twenty\npersons of an evening, he gives himself up to his thoughts without\nrestraint, and frequently maintains a complete reserve. To enjoy the\nfull flavor of his mind, which is my peculiar pleasure and greatest\nhappiness, nothing is more favorable than the presence of a third\nperson, especially if that third person is one of merit. The Marquis\nthen takes the trouble to be charming, at first out of politeness and\nthen little by little out of a fastidious desire to please, though he\nmay not suspect it himself. In fact, he is a man who needs to be drawn\naway from his own reflections, and he is so perfect to me that I have\nnot the right or the wish to enter upon this contest openly, while the\npresence of a person, who even without saying anything is supposed to\nlisten, forces him to exert himself; seeing that, if he fears to appear\na pedant by speaking too much, he fears still more to appear affected\nwhen he forgets himself in thought. So, my dear, you will do us both a\ngreat service in not leaving us too much alone.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, Madame,\" I answered, \"if you should have private matters\nto speak about, how shall I know?\"\n\nThereupon she promised that in such a case she would give me notice by\nasking me _if the clock is not slow._\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE LETTER TO MADAME\nHEUDEBERT.\n\n\nI go on with my letter which sleep forced me to leave off last night,\nand, as it is only nine o\'clock and as I do not see the Marchioness\nbefore noon, I have all the intervening time to complete the details\nwhich will be necessary to post you as to my situation.\n\nBut it seems to me that I have described the Marquis to you\nsufficiently, and that you can now very well represent him to yourself.\nTo answer all your questions, I am going to tell you how my days are\npassed.\n\nThe first fortnight was a little hard, I confess, now that I have\nobtained a very necessary modification of my duties. You know how much\nneed I have of exercise, and how active I have been for the last six\nyears; but here, alas! I have no house to keep in order and to run over\nfrom top to bottom a hundred times a day, no child to walk with and to\nmake play, not even a dog with which I can run, under the pretext of\namusing it. The Marchioness has a horror of animals; she goes out but\nonce or twice a week to ride up and down the avenue of the\nChamps-Élysées. She calls that taking exercise. Infirm and unable to\ngo up stairs, except with the aid of a servant\'s arm,--a thing dreadful\nenough to her, for she was once let fall in doing it,--she pays no\nvisits, though she passes her life in receiving them. All the activity,\nall the vigor of her existence, is in her head, and much in her speech;\nshe talks remarkably well and she knows it; but she is not on that\naccount guilty of any weak vanity, and thinks less of making herself\nheard than of venting the ideas and sentiments which agitate her.\n\nShe has, you see, an energetic nature and a singular earnestness in her\nopinions of all things, even of those which seem to me of very little\naccount. She could never be quite happy; she has been seeking to be so\ntoo long; and living with her incessantly is tiresome, in spite of the\nattraction which she exercises. Her hands are perfectly idle;\nnevertheless her sight is sharp and her fingers are still nimble, for\nshe plays tolerably upon the piano; but she eschews everything that\ninterferes with talking and no longer asks me to read or to play. She\nsays that she holds my talents in reserve for the country, where she\nfinds herself more alone and whither we are to go in two months. I look\nforward to this change with real pleasure, as here the life of the body\nis too much suppressed. And then the good Marchioness has the habit of\nliving in a temperature of Senegal, besides covering herself with\nperfumes, and her apartment is filled with the most odorous of flowers;\nthey are very beautiful to see, but in the absence of air, it is not so\neasy a thing to breathe.\n\nMoreover I have to be idle, like her. I tried at first to embroider\nwhile with her; that, I saw very soon, disturbed her nerves. She asked\nme if I was working by the day, if there was any hurry for what I was\ndoing, if it was very useful, and she interrupted a dozen times with no\nother motive than to see me stop the work which annoyed her. At last I\nhad to abandon it altogether or it would have thrown her into a fit of\nillness. She was well pleased at this, and in order to insure herself\nagainst a renewal of the attempt on my part, she gave me a very frank\nexposition of her way of thinking in such matters. She holds that women\nwho busy their hands and eyes with needlework put a great deal more of\ntheir minds into it than they are themselves willing to acknowledge. It\nis, according to her, a way of stultifying one\'s self in order to escape\nthe tedium of existence. She does not understand it except in the hands\nof unhappy persons and of prisoners. And then she sweetened the draught\nfor me by adding that this sort of work gave me the appearance of a\nlady\'s maid and that she wished me to be in the eyes of all her visitors\nher companion and her friend. So she puts me forward in conversation,\nreferring to me frequently in order to force me to \"show my\nintelligence,\"--what I am especially careful not to do, for I feel that\nI have none at all when people are looking at me and listening to me.\n\nI do my best, however, not to sit stolidly motionless, and I regret\ndeeply that my old friend--since my friend she really is--does not\nconsent to receive from me the most trifling service; she even rings for\nher maid to pick up her pocket-handkerchief, unless I hasten to seize\nit, and yet she reproaches me with devoting myself to her too much, not\nperceiving that I suffer for the want of something to which I can devote\nmyself.\n\nYou may ask why, therefore, she has taken me into her service; I will\ntell you: she does not receive before four o\'clock, and up to that\ntime--that is, as soon as the Marquis leaves her--she hears the reading\nof the newspapers and attends to her correspondence; it is I, then, who\nread and write for her. Why she does not read and write herself, I am\nsure I do not know, for she is very able to do both. I think, however,\nI can see that she cannot endure solitude, and that the dread with which\nit inspires her cannot be counteracted by any occupation whatever.\nCertainly there is in her something strange which does not appear, but\nwhich exists in the secret places of her heart or head. Hers is perhaps\na nature a little perverted by the relations it has been forced to\nsustain toward others. It is too late to teach her to be busy, and\nperhaps she cannot even think when she is alone.\n\nIt is certain that when I enter her apartment at the stroke of noon I\nfind her very different from what I left her the night before in the\nmidst of her drawing-room. She seems to grow ten years older every\nnight. I know that her maids make a long toilet for her, during which\nshe does not speak a single word to them, for she has a great contempt\nfor people whose language is vulgar. She becomes so annoyed by the\npresence of these poor women (perhaps she has been sleepless, which also\nannoys her desperately), that she appears half dead and is frightfully\npale when I first see her; but at the end of ten minutes this is no\nlonger the case; she becomes thoroughly waked up, and by the time the\nMarquis arrives she has regained the ten years of the night.\n\nHer correspondence, of which I ought to say nothing, although there is\nnot the least secret about it, is by no means a necessity of her\nposition or of her interests. It merely gratifies her need to talk with\nher absent friends. It is, she says, a manner of speaking, of exchanging\nideas, which varies the only pleasure she knows, namely, that of being\nin continual communication with the minds of others.\n\nSo be it! but, for my part, that would not be my taste, if I were\ntroubled with leisure. I would please myself only with those I loved,\nand certainly the Marchioness cannot love very much the forty or fifty\npersons to whom she writes, and the two or three hundred whom she\nreceives every week.\n\nMy taste, however, does not come into the question, and I will not\ncriticise her to whom I have given my liberty. That would be cowardly,\nfor, after all, if I did not esteem or respect her, I should be free to\nbetake myself elsewhere. Besides, supposing my respect and esteem are\ncumbered by the endurance of certain eccentricities,--as I might\neverywhere meet with eccentricities, and probably worse things,--I do\nnot see why I should look with a magnifying-glass upon those which I\nwant to put up with cheerfully and philosophically. Then, dear sister,\nif I have happened to blame or ridicule any one or anything here, take\nit as having escaped me inadvertently, and believe that with you I have\nnot cared to restrain myself; for, be assured, nothing troubles me or\ngives me any real suffering.\n\nThe gist of all this is that in the soul of the Marchioness there is\nsomething strong, warm, and therefore sincere, which really attaches me\nto her and causes me to accept without the least repugnance the task of\ndiverting her and keeping her cheerful. I know very well, whatever she\nmay say, that I am something much worse than an attendant; I am a slave;\nbut I am so by my own will, and therefore I feel in my conscience as\nfree as the air. What is freer than the spirit of a captive, or of one\nproscribed for his faith?\n\nI had not reflected upon all this when I left you, my sister; I believed\nthat I would have to suffer a great deal. Well, I have reflected upon it\nnow, and, save the want of exercise, which is altogether a physical\nmatter, I have not suffered at all. That little suffering will be spared\nme hereafter; do not torment yourself about it. I was forced to\nacknowledge it to you. Henceforth I shall be permitted to go to sleep\nearly enough, and I can walk in the garden of the hotel, which is not\nlarge, but in which I succeed in going a good way, while thinking of you\nand our wide fields. Then I imagine myself there, with you and the\nchildren around me,--a beautiful dream, which does me good.\n\nBut I perceive that I have told you nothing yet of the Duke; I now come\nto that subject.\n\nIt was no more than three days ago that I finally got sight of him. I\nwill confess that I was not very impatient to see him. I could not help\nfeeling a sort of horror of the man who has ruined his mother, and who,\nit is said, is adorned with every vice. Well, my surprise was very\ngreat, and if my aversion to his character abides, I am forced to say\nthat his person is not, as I had pictured it, disagreeable to me.\n\nIn my dread I had endowed him with claws and horns. Nevertheless, you\nshall see how I approached this demon without recognizing him. I must\ntell you first that nothing could be more irregular than his relations\nwith his mother. There are weeks, months even, in which he comes to see\nher almost every day; then he disappears, is not spoken of for months or\nweeks, and when he appears again there is no more explanation on one\nside or the other than if he had gone away the night before. I do not\nknow yet how the Marchioness takes this. I have sometimes heard her\nmention her eldest son as calmly and respectfully as if she were\nspeaking of the Marquis, and you may well suppose that I have never\npermitted myself to ask the least question upon a subject so delicate.\nShe merely related once in my presence, but without any sort of comment,\nwhat I have just told you about the capricious irregularity of his\nvisits.\n\nI had indeed expected him sooner or later to make some sudden or\nmysterious appearance, but I was not thinking at all of him when,\nentering the drawing-room after dinner, as I usually do, to see that\neverything is arranged to suit the Marchioness, I did not notice a\npersonage quietly installed there in a corner upon a small sofa. When\nthe Marchioness has dined she returns to her apartment, where her maids\nply her with a little white and rouge, and she remains there a quarter\nof an hour, while I inspect the lamps and flower-stands of the\ndrawing-room. I was therefore absorbed in that grave duty, and profiting\nby the chance to give myself a little exercise, I moved to and fro very\nquickly, singing one of our home songs, when I found myself confronted\nby a pair of large blue eyes of unusual clearness. I bowed, asking\npardon. The owner of the eyes arose, apologizing in turn, and, left to\ndo the honors, but not knowing what to say to a new face which seemed to\nbe asking me who I was, I chose the part of saying nothing at all.\n\nThe man having attained his feet, turned his back to the mantel-piece,\nand followed me with his eyes with an air of kindness rather than\nastonishment. He is tall, somewhat heavy-made, with a large face,\nand--what is most surprising--very attractive features. He could not\nhave a sweeter, a more humane, even a more candid expression; the tone\nof his voice is subdued and tender, and there are in his pronunciation,\nas in his manners, the unmistakable marks of high-breeding. I will say\neven that there is a certain suavity in the slightest movements of this\nrattlesnake, and that his smile is like a child\'s.\n\nDo you begin to understand something of the truth? For my part I was so\nfar from suspecting it that I went nearer to the mantel-piece, feeling\nmyself drawn thither, as it were, by the kindliness with which he\nregarded me, and I stood ready to reply in the most affable manner if he\nshould feel inclined to speak to me. He appeared desirous to begin, and\ndid so very frankly.\n\n\"Is Mlle Esther ill?\" he asked in his soft voice and with a very polite\nintonation.\n\n\"Mlle Esther has not been here for two months,\" I answered. \"I never\nknew her. It is I who have taken her place.\"\n\n\"O no!\"\n\n\"Pardon me.\"\n\n\"Say that you have succeeded her! Spring does not take the place of\nwinter; it causes it to be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Winter can nevertheless have good in it.\"\n\n\"O, you did not know Esther! She was sharp as the north-wind of\nDecember, and when she came near you you felt the approach of\nrheumatism!\"\n\nThen he went into a description of the poor Esther which was very\nlively, though not at all malicious, and it was altogether so droll that\nI could not restrain a burst of laughter.\n\n\"That\'s right!\" he rejoined; \"but do you laugh? Then we shall hear\nlaughter here! I hope you laugh often?\"\n\n\"Certainly, when there is a good occasion.\"\n\n\"There never was a good occasion for Esther. After all she was right: if\nshe had laughed she would have shown her teeth. Ah! but do not hide\nyours. I have seen them, and yet I shall say nothing about them. I know\nnothing sillier than compliments. Would it be impertinent to ask your\nname? But no; do not tell me it. I guessed Esther\'s: I baptized her\nRebecca. You see that I detected the race. I want to guess yours.\"\n\n\"Come, then, guess.\"\n\n\"Well, a very French name,--Louise, Blanche, Charlotte?\"\n\n\"That\'s it; my name is Caroline.\"\n\n\"There! you see--and you come from one of the provinces?\"\n\n\"From the country.\"\n\n\"But see! why have n\'t you red hands? Do you like it here in Paris?\"\n\n\"No, not at all.\"\n\n\"I will lay a wager your relatives have compelled you--\"\n\n\"No, no one has compelled me.\"\n\n\"But you find it tedious here? Confess now that you do.\"\n\n\"O no; I never find it tedious anywhere.\"\n\n\"You are no longer frank.\"\n\n\"I assure you I am.\"\n\n\"You are then very reasonable?\"\n\n\"I pride myself on being so.\"\n\n\"And positive, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Romantic, though?\"\n\n\"Still less.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"How nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing that merits the slightest attention. I can read, write, and\nreckon. I thrum a little on the piano. I am very obedient. I am\nconscientious in the discharge of my duties, and that is all it is\nimportant that I should be here.\"\n\n\"Well, now, you do not know yourself. Do you want me to tell you what\nyou are? You are a person of intelligence and an excellent soul.\"\n\n\"You believe so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. I see very quickly, and I judge tolerably well. And\nyou? Do you form an idea of people at first sight?\"\n\n\"O yes, more or less.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what do you think of me, for example?\"\n\n\"Naturally I think of you what you think of me.\"\n\n\"Is that out of gratitude or of politeness?\"\n\n\"No, it is from a sort of instinct.\"\n\n\"Indeed? I thank you for it. Now I will tell you what really gives me\npleasure: not brightness of mind, by any means; almost everybody can\nhave that; it can at least in a measure be acquired; but thorough\ngoodness,--you do not think me very bad, do you? Then,--come, will you\nlet me take your hand?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I will tell you directly. Do you refuse me? There is nothing more\nhonest in the world than the sentiment which causes me to ask that favor\nof you.\"\n\nThere was something so true and so touching in the face and accent of\nthis man, that, in spite of the strangeness of his demand and the still\ngreater strangeness of my consent, I put my hand in his with confidence.\nHe pressed it gently, detaining it but a second; but tears came to his\neyes and he faltered as if with suffocation, \"Thanks; take good care of\nmy poor mother!\"\n\nAnd I, comprehending at last that this was the Duke d\'Aléria, and that\nI had just been touching the hand of this soulless profligate, this\nundutiful son, this heartless brother, in a word this man without\nrestraint or conscience, I felt my limbs giving way under me and I\nleaned upon the table, becoming so exceedingly pale that he noticed it,\nand made a movement toward sustaining me, while he exclaimed, \"What! are\nyou ill?\"\n\nBut he paused when he perceived the dread and disgust with which he\ninspired me, or perhaps merely because his mother was just entering the\nroom. She saw my trouble, and looked at the Duke as if to demand of him\nthe cause. He answered only by kissing her hand in the most tender and\nrespectful manner, and by asking the news about herself. I immediately\nretired, as much to collect myself as to leave them alone together.\n\nWhen I re-entered the drawing-room several persons had arrived, and I\nentered into conversation with a certain Madame de D----, who is\nparticularly kind to me, and who appears to be an excellent woman. She\ncannot, however, endure the Duke, and it is she who has told me all the\nevil I know of him. A feeling of reaction against the sympathy with\nwhich he had inspired me caused me, no doubt, to seek now the society of\nthis lady.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, as if she had divined what was passing in me, while\nshe regarded the Duke, then engaged in conversation not far from his\nmother, \"you have at last seen him, the \'beloved child\'? What have you\nto say of him?\"\n\n\"He is amiable and handsome, and that is what in my eyes condemns him\nall the more.\"\n\n\"Yes, is it not so? His is certainly a fine organization, and it is\nincredible that he should be so well preserved and so intellectually\nbright after the life he has led; but do not go to trusting him. He is\nthe most corrupt being that exists, and he is perfectly able to play the\ngood apostle with you in order to compromise you.\"\n\n\"With me? O no! The humbleness of my position will preserve me from his\nattention.\"\n\n\"Not at all. You will see. I will not tell you that your merit raises\nyou above your position, since that is evident to everybody; but to know\nthat you are honest will be enough to inspire him with a desire to lead\nyou astray.\"\n\n\"Do not attempt to frighten me; I would not stay here an hour, Madame,\nif I thought I were going to be insulted.\"\n\n\"No, no; that is not what you need apprehend. He is always gentlemanly\nin the society of gentle and pure people, and you will never have to\nguard yourself from any impropriety on his part. Quite the contrary; if\nyou are not careful he will persuade you that he is a repentant angel,\nperhaps even a saint in disguise, and--you will be his dupe.\"\n\nMadame de D---- said these last words in a compassionate tone which\nwounded me. I was going to reply, but I remembered what I had heard\nanother old lady say, namely, that a daughter of Madame de D---- had\nbeen very much compromised by the Duke. The poor woman must suffer\nhorribly at the sight of him, and I thus explain to myself how a person\nso indulgent toward all the world speaks of him with such bitterness;\nbut I do not so easily explain to myself why, in spite of her repugnance\nat seeing him and hearing him named, she speaks of him to me with a sort\nof insistence every time she can get me aside. One would indeed think\nthat I were destined to be taken in the snares of this Lovelace, and\nthat she sought her revenge in disputing my poor soul with him.\n\nA moment of reflection led me to regard her excessive fear as a trifle\nridiculous, and wishing neither to make her angry with me nor to remind\nher of her own griefs, I have from that moment avoided speaking of her\nenemy. Besides, the Duke did not say another word to me that evening,\nand since that evening he has not made his appearance. If I am in any\n_danger_ I have not perceived it yet; but you can be as much at rest on\nthat subject as I am myself, for I have not the least fear of people\nwhom I do not esteem.\n\n\nIn the rest of the letter Caroline treats of other persons and\ncircumstances that had more or less excited her attention. As those\ndetails do not connect directly with our story, we suppress them now,\nthough expecting our narrative to lead us back to them.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAbout this time Caroline received a letter which touched her deeply, and\nwhich we will transcribe without giving the incorrect spelling and\npunctuation, that would indeed make it difficult to read.\n\n\nMy dear Caroline,--permit your poor nurse always to address you this\nway,--I have just learned from your elder sister, who has done me the\nfavor of writing me, that you have left her house to become the\ncompanion of a lady in Paris. I cannot describe the pain it gives me to\nthink that a person like you, born to ease, as I know, should be obliged\nto be subject to others, and when I think that it is all of your own\ngood heart, and to help Camille and her children, the tears come to my\neyes. My dear young lady, I have only one thing to say, and that is,\nthanks to the generosity of your parents, that I am not among the most\nunfortunate. My husband is pretty well off, and carries on besides a\nsmall business, which has enabled us to buy a house and a bit of land.\nMy son is a soldier, and your foster-sister has married quite well. So\nif you should be in want of a few hundred francs some day or other, we\nshould be happy to lend them to you, for any length of time and without\ninterest. By accepting this offer, you will honor and please persons who\nhave always loved you; for my husband esteems you very much, though he\nknows you only through me, and he often says to me, \"She ought to come\nto us; we could keep her as long as she liked, and as she is strong and\na good walker, we could show her our mountains. If she would, she might,\ntoo, be the school-mistress of our village; this would not bring her in\nmuch, to be sure; but then her expenses would be small, and it would\namount, perhaps, to the same as her salary in Paris, where living is so\ndear.\" I tell you this just exactly as Peyraque says it, and if your own\nheart will say the same, we shall have a neat little room all ready for\nyou, and a somewhat wild country to show you. You will not feel\nafraid,--for when you were a very little thing even, you were always\nwanting to climb everywhere, so that your poor papa would call you his\nlittle squirrel.\n\nRemember then, if you are not comfortable where you are, dear Caroline\nof my heart, that in a little corner of what is to you an unknown\ncountry there are those who know you for the best soul in the wide\nworld, and who pray for you every night and morning, asking the good God\nto bring you here to see us.\n\n\nJUSTINE LANION,\nPEYRAQUE by marriage.\n\nLANTRIAC, near LE PUY, HAUTE LOIRE.\n\n\nCaroline replied immediately, as follows:--\n\n\"My good Justine, my dear friend,--I wept while reading your letter.\nThey were tears of joy and gratitude. How happy I am to find your\nfriendship as tender as it was on the day when we parted from one\nanother, fourteen years ago! That day lingers in my memory as one of the\nsaddest in my whole life. I had learned to know no mother but you, and\nlosing you was being left motherless for the second time. My good nurse,\nyou loved me so much that for me you had almost forgotten your good\nhusband and your dear children! But they recalled you, your first duty\nwas to them, and I saw from all your letters that they were making you\nhappy. It was they who paid you my debt, for I owed you a great deal;\nand I have often thought that, if there is anything good or reasonable\nin me, it is because I have been treated lovingly, gently, and\nreasonably by her whom my childish eyes first learned to know. Now you\nwant to offer me your savings, you dear good soul! That is good and\nmotherly, like you, and on the part of your husband, who does not know\nme, it is great and noble. I thank you tenderly, my kind friends, but I\nneed nothing. I am well provided for where I am, and I am as happy as I\ncan be away from my own dear family.\n\n\"I shall not give up the hope of going to see you, all the same. What\nyou tell me about the neat little room and the fine wild country gives\nme a strong desire to know your village and your little household. I\ncannot say when, in the course of my life, I shall find a fortnight of\nliberty; but be assured that if I ever do find it, it shall be at the\ndisposal of my darling nurse, whom I embrace with all my heart.\"\n\nWhile Caroline was giving herself up to this frank outburst of feeling,\nthe Duke, Gaëtan d\'Aléria, in a splendid Turkish morning costume, was\nconversing with his brother, the Marquis, from whom he was receiving a\nmorning call in his elegant apartments on the Rue de la Paix.\n\nThey had just been speaking of business matters, and a lively discussion\nhad arisen between the two brothers. \"No, my friend,\" said the Duke, in\na firm tone, \"I will be energetic this time: I refuse your signature;\nyou shall not pay my debts!\"\n\n\"I will pay them,\" rejoined the Marquis, in a tone just as resolute. \"It\nmust be done; I ought to do it. I had some hesitation, I will not deny,\nbefore knowing the sum-total, and your pride need not suffer from the\nscruples I felt. I was afraid of becoming involved beyond my ability;\nbut I know now that there will be enough left to maintain our mother\ncomfortably. I have, therefore, determined to save the honor of the\nfamily, and you cannot stand in the way.\"\n\n\"I do stand in the way: you do not owe me this sacrifice; we do not bear\nthe same name.\"\n\n\"We are the sons of the same mother, and I do not want her to die of\ngrief and shame at seeing you insolvent.\"\n\n\"I have no more desire for such a disgrace than my mother has. I will\nmarry.\"\n\n\"For money? In my mother\'s eyes, and in mine, as well as in yours, my\nbrother, that would be worse still,--you know it perfectly well!\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will accept a place.\"\n\n\"Worse, still worse!\"\n\n\"No, there is nothing worse for me than the pain of ruining you.\"\n\n\"I shall not be ruined.\"\n\n\"And may I not know the whole amount of my debts?\"\n\n\"It is of no use; enough that you have pledged your word that there is\nnone unknown to the notary, who has charge of the settlement. I have\nonly requested you to be so good as to look over some of these papers to\nprove their correctness, if that be possible. You have verified them;\nthat is enough, the rest does not concern you.\"\n\nThe Duke crumpled the papers angrily, and strode about the room, unable\nto find words for his mental distress. Then he lighted a cigar which he\ndid not smoke, threw himself into an armchair and became very pale. The\nMarquis understood the suffering of his brother\'s pride, and perhaps of\nhis conscience.\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" he said. \"I sympathize with your sorrow; but it is a\ngood sign, and I trust to the future. Forget this service, which I am\ndoing for my mother rather than for you; but do not forget that whatever\nis left is henceforth hers. Consider that we may yet have the happiness\nof keeping her with us a long while, and that she needs not necessarily\nsuffer. Farewell. I will see you again in an hour, to arrange the last\ndetails.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, leave me alone,\" replied the Duke; \"you see that I cannot say\na word to you now.\"\n\nAs soon as the Marquis was gone the Duke rang, gave orders that no one\nshould be admitted, and began to pace the room as before, with desperate\nagitation. In this hour, he was passing through the supreme and\ninevitable crisis of his destiny. In none of his other disasters had he\nseen so much of his own guilt or felt so much real concern.\n\nUp to this time, in fact, he had squandered his own fortune with that\nhardy recklessness which arises from the sense of injuring no one but\none\'s self. He had, so to speak, only made use of a right; then, half\nwithout his own knowledge, by encroaching upon his mother\'s capital, he\nhad consumed it entirely, becoming gradually hardened to the disgrace of\nthrowing upon his brother the duty of maintaining her from his own\nresources. Let us say all that we can in excuse of the Duke\'s conduct up\nto this period. He had been fearfully spoiled; in his mother\'s heart a\nvery marked preference for him had existed; nature, too, had been\npartial to him; taller, stronger, more elegant, more brilliant, and\napparently more active than his brother, and more demonstratively\naffectionate from childhood, he had seemed to every one the better\nendowed and the more amiable of the two. For a long while weakly and\ntaciturn, the Marquis had shown no fondness for anything but study; and\nthis taste, which in a plebeian would have seemed a great advantage, was\nconsidered eccentric in a man of rank. This tendency was therefore\nrepressed rather than encouraged, and precisely on that account it\nbecame a passion,--an absorbing, pent-up passion, which developed in the\nyoung man\'s soul a quick, inward sensibility and an enthusiasm all the\nmore ardent from having been restrained. The Marquis was far more\naffectionate than his brother, and yet passed for a man of cold nature,\nwhile the Duke, always kindly and communicative, without loving any one\nexclusively, had long passed for the very soul of warmth.\n\nThe Duke inherited from his father the impulsive temperament which had\nproved so delusive, and during his childhood the wild freedom of his\nways had given the Marchioness some anxiety. We have mentioned already\nthat after the death of her second husband she had been very much\ncarried away by grief, and that for more than a year she had shrunk from\nseeing her children. When this moral disease gave place to natural\nfeeling, her first effort was to clasp in her arms the son of the\nhusband whom she had loved. But the child, surprised and perhaps\nterrified by the impetuosity of caresses which he had almost forgotten,\nburst into tears without knowing why. It may have been the vague,\ninstinctive reproach of a nature chilled by neglect. The Duke, older\nthan he by three years, but more easily diverted, perceived nothing of\nall this. He returned his mother\'s kisses, and the poor woman imagined\nthat he inherited her own warm heart, while the Marquis, she thought,\nhad the traits of his paternal grandfather, a man of letters, but not\nquite sane. So the Duke was secretly preferred, though not more kindly\ntreated, for the Marchioness had a deep and almost religious sense of\njustice; but he was petted more, since he alone, she believed,\nappreciated the value of a caress.\n\nUrbain (the Marquis) felt this partiality and suffered from it; but he\nnever allowed himself to complain, and perhaps, already putting a just\nestimate upon his brother, he did not care to contend with him on such\nfrivolous grounds.\n\nIn the course of time, the Marchioness found out that she had been\ngreatly mistaken, and that sentiments should be judged by deeds rather\nthan by words; but the habit of spoiling her prodigal son had now become\nfixed, and to this she soon added a tender pity for the bewildered\nperversity which seemed to be leading the wilful youth to his own\ndestruction. This perversity, however, did not take its rise in an evil\nheart. Vanity at first, and dissipation afterward, then the loss of\nenergy, and at last the tyranny of vice,--that, briefly, is the history\nof this man, charming without real refinement, good without grandeur of\nsoul, sceptical without atheism. At the age when we are describing him,\nthere was in him an awful void in the place where his conscience should\nhave been, and yet it was a conscience rather absent than dead. There\nwould sometimes be returns of it, and struggles with it, fewer and\nbriefer indeed than they had been in his youth, but perhaps on that\naccount all the more desperate; and the one which was going on within\nhim at this time was so cruel that he laid his hand repeatedly upon one\nof his splendid weapons, as if he were haunted by the spectre of\nsuicide; but he thought of his mother, pushed away the pistols and\nlocked them up, putting both hands to his head, in the fear that he was\nbecoming insane.\n\nHe had always looked upon money as nothing. His mother\'s noble\ndisinterested theories on the subject had made the way of false\nreasoning easy to him. Nevertheless he understood that, in effecting his\nmother\'s ruin, he had overstepped his right. He was astounded; he had\ngone on up to the last, promising himself that he would stop before\nreaching his brother\'s fortune, and then he had seriously encroached\nupon it; but the truth is, that he had not done this knowingly; for,\nfrom motives of delicacy, the Marquis had kept no accounts with him in\nmatters of detail, and would never have mentioned them at all, had it\nnot been for the necessity of preserving by an appeal to his honor the\nlittle which was left. The Duke therefore did not feel himself guilty of\ndeliberate selfishness, and had reproached Urbain warmly and sincerely\nfor not having warned him sooner. He saw at last the abyss opened by his\nlawless and reckless conduct; he was bitterly ashamed of having injured\nhis brother\'s prospects and of having no way to repair the harm, without\ninfringing upon certain rigid principles established by his mother and\nhis education.\n\nYet this error was less serious than that of having wronged his own\nmother; but it did not appear so to the Duke. It had always seemed to\nhim that whatever belonged to his mother was his own, while in dealing\nwith his brother his pride kept up the distinction of _meum_ and _tuum._\nBesides,--should it not be admitted?--while there was no wicked dislike\nbetween the two brothers so differently constituted, there was at least\na want of confidence and sympathy. The life of the one was a continual\nprotest against that of the other. Urbain had made a silent but powerful\neffort that the voice of nature within him might be also that of\nfriendship. Gaëtan had made no such effort; trusting to the freedom\nfrom malice which characterized him, he had felt a liberty to rail at\nthe austerity of the Marquis. They were then together most of the time,\nupon a footing of blame delicately restrained by the one, and of\nridicule manifested in easy revolt by the other.\n\n\"Very well,\" exclaimed the Duke, seeing the Marquis return. \"It is an\naccomplished fact then? I see by your face that you have been signing.\"\n\n\"Yes, brother,\" replied Urbain; \"it is all arranged, and there is left\nfor you besides an income of twelve thousand francs, which I did not\nallow them to use in the liquidation.\"\n\n\"Left for me?\" rejoined Gaëtan, looking him in the face. \"No! you are\ndeceived, there is nothing left for me; but, after having cleared me of\ndebt, you are yourself making me an allowance.\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" replied the Marquis, \"since you must also learn, sooner or\nlater, that you are not at liberty to dispose of the principal.\"\n\nThe Duke, who had not yet decided upon anything, wrung his hands with\nviolence and fell back upon his mute opposition. The Marquis made an\neffort to conquer his habitual reserve, seated himself near Gaëtan, and\ntaking in his own the clenched hands which seemed hesitating to extend\nthemselves to him, \"My friend,\" said he, \"you are too haughty with me.\nWould you not have done for me what I am doing for you?\"\n\nThe Duke felt his pride breaking down. He burst into tears. \"No!\" said\nhe, pressing his brother\'s hand feelingly, \"I never should have known\nhow to do it. I never could have done it, for my destiny is to injure\nothers, and I shall never have the happiness of saving any one.\"\n\n\"You will at least admit that it is a happiness,\" replied Urbain. \"Then\nconsider yourself doing me a kindness, and give me back your friendship\nwhich seems to be vanishing under this grievance.\"\n\n\"Urbain,\" cried the Duke, \"you speak of my friendship. Now would be the\ntime to thank you with all manner of protestations, but I will not do\nit; I will never fall so low as to take refuge in hypocrisy. Do you\nknow, brother, that I have never liked you very well?\"\n\n\"I know it, and I account for it by our differing tastes and\ndispositions; but has not the time now come to like each other better?\"\n\n\"Ah! it is an awful time for that,--the hour of your triumph and of my\ndisgrace. Tell me that, but for my mother, you would have let me\nsuccumb. Yes, you must tell me that, and then I may forgive you for what\nyou are doing.\"\n\n\"Have I not already said so?\"\n\n\"Tell me so again! You hesitate? It is then a question of the family\nhonor?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is that precisely, the family honor is in question.\"\n\n\"And you do not expect me to love you to-day more than on any other\nday?\"\n\n\"I know,\" rejoined the Marquis, sadly, \"that personally I am not made to\nbe loved.\"\n\nThe Duke felt himself completely conquered; he threw himself into his\nbrother\'s arms. \"Come!\" he cried, \"forgive me. You are a better man than\nI. I respect you, admire you, I almost worship you; I know, I feel that\nyou are my best friend. My God! what is there that I can do for you? Do\nyou love any woman? Shall I kill her husband? Do you want me to go to\nChina and find some precious manuscript, in some pagoda, risking the\n_cangue_, and other pleasant things?\"\n\n\"You think of nothing but a discharge of obligations, Gaëtan. If you\nwould only love me a little, I should be already paid a hundred times\nover.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I do love you with all my heart,\" replied the Duke,\nembracing him violently; \"and you see I am weeping like a child. Look\nhere! Give me a little esteem in return; I will reform. I am still\nyoung. Why, the deuce take it all, at thirty-six one can\'t have been\nruined altogether! A fellow is only a little used up. I will turn over a\nnew leaf,--all the more because that is needed in my case. Well, then,\nso much the better! I will renew my youth, my health. I will go and pass\nthe summer with you and my mother in the country; I will tell you\nstories; I will make you laugh again. Come! help me lay my plans,\nsupport me, lift me up, console me; for, after all, I don\'t know where I\nam, and I feel very unhappy.\"\n\nThe Marquis had already noticed, without appearing to do so, the\ndisappearance of the weapons which had been in sight an hour before. He\nhad also read in his brother\'s face the fearful crisis through which he\nhad passed. He knew furthermore that Gaëtan\'s moral courage would only\nbear a certain amount of strain. \"Dress yourself now,\" he said, \"and\ncome to breakfast with me. We will chat; we will build air-castles. Who\nknows but I may convince you that, in certain cases, we begin to be rich\non the very day we become poor?\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe Marquis conducted his brother to the Bois de Boulogne, which at that\nperiod was not a splendid English garden, but a charming grove of dreamy\nshade. It was one of the first days of April; the weather was\nmagnificent; the thickets were covered with violets, and a thousand\nfoolish tomtits were chattering around the first buds, while the\ncitron-hued butterflies of those early beautiful days seemed, by their\nform, their color, and their undecided flight, like new leaves\nfluttering gently in the wind.\n\nThe Marquis was ordinarily thought to take his meals at home. In\nreality, he did not take his meals at all, using those terms after the\nmanner of generous livers. He had a few very simple dishes served up,\nand he swallowed them hastily, without raising his eyes from the book at\nhis side. That frugal habit agreed very well with the rule of strict\neconomy which he was now about to adopt; for, in order that his mother\'s\ntable might continue to be carefully and abundantly served, it was\nnecessary that his own should not in the future be allowed the least\nsuperfluity.\n\nNot only anxious to conceal this fact from his brother, but fearing,\nalso, to sadden him by the usual austerity of his mode of life, the\nMarquis led him to a pavilion in the Bois and ordered a comfortable\nrepast, saying to himself that he would buy so many books the less, and\nfrequent the public libraries by necessity, neither more nor less than a\nneedy scholar. He felt himself in no way saddened or appalled by a\nsuccession of little sacrifices. He did not think even of his delicate\nhealth, which demanded a certain amount of comforts in his sedentary\nlife. He was happy at having finally broken down the cold barrier\nbetween himself and Gaëtan, and also at the prospect of gaining his\nconfidence and affection. The Duke, who was still pale and nervously\nthoughtful, began to yield himself up more and more to the influence of\nthe spring air which entered freely through the open window. The meal\nrestored the equilibrium of his faculties, for he was of a robust\nnature, that could not endure privation; and his mother, who had certain\npretensions of alliance to the ex-royal family, was in the habit of\nsaying, somewhat vainly, that the Duke had the fine appetite of the\nBourbons.\n\nIn the course of an hour the Duke was charming in his manner toward his\nbrother; that is, he was with him, for the first time in his life, as\namiable and as much at his ease as he was with everybody else. These two\nmen had sometimes perhaps divined more or less of each other, but a\nthorough understanding had never been reached; and, surely, they had\nnever questioned each other openly. The Marquis had been restrained by\ndiscretion; the Duke by indifference. Now the Duke felt a real need to\nknow the man who had just rescued his honor and made him certain of his\nfuture. He questioned the Marquis with a freedom which had never before\nhad place between them.\n\n\"Explain your happiness to me,\" he said, \"for you are really happy; at\nleast, I have never heard you complain.\"\n\nThe Marquis made a reply which astonished him greatly. \"I cannot explain\nto you my courage,\" he said, \"except by my devotion to my mother and by\nmy love for study, since, as for happiness, I never had it and never\nshall have it. That, perhaps, is not what I should say to allure you to\na quiet and retired life; but I would commit a crime not to be sincere\nwith you; and besides, I shall never make myself a pretender to virtue,\nthough you have slightly accused me of that eccentricity.\"\n\n\"It is true; I was very wrong; I see it now. But how and why are you\nunhappy, my poor brother? Can you tell me?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, but I will confide in you. I have loved!\"\n\n\"You? you have loved a woman? When was that?\"\n\n\"It is now a long time ago, and I loved her a long time.\"\n\n\"And you do not love her any more?\"\n\n\"She is dead.\"\n\n\"She was a married woman?\"\n\n\"Precisely, and her husband is yet living. You will permit me to conceal\nher name.\"\n\n\"There is no need whatever to mention that; but you will conquer this\nfeeling, will you not?\"\n\n\"I do not positively know. Up to the present time I have not succeeded\nat all.\"\n\n\"She has not been dead long?\"\n\n\"Three years.\"\n\n\"She loved you then very much?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How, no?\"\n\n\"She loved me as much as a woman can love who ought not and will not\nbreak with her husband.\"\n\n\"Bah! that\'s no reason; on the contrary, obstacles stimulate passion.\"\n\n\"And they wear it out. She was weary with deceiving, and consequently of\nsuffering. It was only the fear of driving me to despair that hindered\nher from breaking with me. I was greatly wanting in courage. She died a\nsuffering death,--and through my fault!\"\n\n\"But no, O no! You imagine that to torment yourself.\"\n\n\"I imagine nothing, and my grief is without resource, as my fault is\nwithout excuse. You shall see. There came one of those paroxysms of\npassion in which we wish, in spite of God and men, to appropriate\nforever the object of our love. She bore me a son whom I saved,\nconcealed, and who still lives; but she, not wishing to give a foothold\nto suspicion, made her appearance in society the day after her delivery.\nThere she seemed still beautiful, and full of her wonted animation; she\nspoke and walked, notwithstanding the fever which was devouring her:\ntwenty-four hours afterwards she was a corpse. Nothing was ever known.\nShe passed for the most rigid person--\"\n\n\"I know who it was,--Madame de G----.\"\n\n\"Yes, you alone in the whole world possess the secret.\"\n\n\"Ah! Do not be so sure. Does not our mother herself suspect it?\"\n\n\"Our mother suspects nothing.\"\n\nThe Duke was silent for a moment, then he said with a sigh, \"My poor\nbrother, this child that is living, and that you probably cherish--\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And I have ruined him too.\"\n\n\"What matter? If he has the means of learning to work, of being a man,\nit will be all that I desire for him. I can never recognize him openly,\nand for some years I do not wish to have him near me. He is very frail;\nI am having him brought up in the country, at the house of some\npeasants. He must get the physical strength which I have always lacked,\nand whose absence has, perhaps, induced in me the want of moral force.\nThen, too, at the last hour, from an imprudent word of the physician, M.\nde G---- gained a suspicion of the truth. It would not do to have about\nme a child whose age should coincide with the time which has intervened\nsince that sad event. Do you not see, Gaëtan, I am not, I cannot be,\nhappy!\"\n\n\"Is it then that passion which keeps you from marrying!\"\n\n\"I shall never marry; I have sworn it.\"\n\n\"Very well, now you must think of it.\"\n\n\"And _you_ preach marriage to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, why not? Marriage is not, as you suppose, the object of my\nscorn! I proclaimed that antipathy to relieve myself of the trouble of\nfinding a wife at the age when I might have chosen one. Since I have\nbeen ruined the thing has become more conditional. My mother would never\nhave allowed me to accept a fortune without a name, and having nothing\nnow but my name, I can no longer aspire to anything but fortune. You\nknow that, wholly detestable as I am, I have never wanted to wound my\nmother by going counter to her opinions. I have therefore seen my\nchances rapidly decrease, and at this moment I should put the worst sort\nof estimate upon any young lady or widow, whatsoever her wealth or\nbirth, who would have me. I should persuade myself that, to accept a\ngood-for-nothing like me, she must have some very dark motive. But,\nUrbain, your position is altogether different; I have lessened your\nfortune, perhaps made you poor. That, however, takes nothing from your\npersonal merit; on the contrary, it should make it greater in the eyes\nof every one knowing the cause of your meagre fortune. It is nothing\nmore than probable that some pure young woman, of noble family and with\na fortune, should be inspired with esteem and affection for you. It\nseems to me even that all you will have to do is but to wish such a\nthing, and to show yourself.\"\n\n\"No, I do not know how to show myself, except to my own disadvantage.\nSociety paralyzes me, and my reputation as a scholar injures more than\nit serves me. Society does not understand why a man born for society\ndoes not prefer it above all things. Besides, you see, I cannot want to\nlove; my heart is too dark and heavy.\"\n\n\"Why, then, do you mourn so long a woman who did not know how to be\nhappy with your affection?\"\n\n\"Because I loved her. In her it was perhaps my own passion that I loved.\nI am not of those lively natures which bloom again at each new season.\nThings take a terrible hold of me.\"\n\n\"You read too much, you reflect too much.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do; come to the country, brother, as you have promised to do;\nyou shall assist me; you will benefit me greatly. Will you come? I have\na real need of a friend, and I have none. A silent passion has absorbed\nmy life; your affection will rejuvenate me.\"\n\nThe Duke was greatly moved by the frank and tender confidence of his\nbrother. He had expected lessons, counsels, consolations, which would\nhave made him play the part of the weak, in the presence of the strong\nman; on the contrary, it was of him that Urbain asked for strength and\npity. Whether this came from an actual need of the Marquis or from an\nexalted delicacy, the Duke was too intelligent not to be struck by the\nchange. He assured him, therefore, of a lively affection, a tender\nsolicitude; and after having spent the whole afternoon talking and\nwalking in the grove, the two brothers took a carriage and returned\ntogether to dine with their mother.\n\nFor some days the Marchioness had been secretly very ill at ease. She\nhad feared the resistance of Urbain when he should learn the whole\namount of his brother\'s debts. However great her esteem for her younger\nson, she had not foreseen to what lengths his disinterestedness would\ngo. Not having received his usual visit on that morning, she became\nseriously troubled, when, just before the hour of dinner, she saw her\ntwo sons arrive. She observed in the face of each such a calm expression\nof confidence and affection as led her at first to divine what had\npassed between them; then, however, in the presence of a visitor who was\nslow to depart, she could not question them, and finally she received\nthe dreadful impression that she had been deceived and that neither the\none nor the other was fully aware of the situation.\n\nBut when they were at last at table, she remarked that they addressed\neach other in the familiar and endearing _thee_ and _thou_, she\nunderstood all, and the presence of Caroline and the servants hindering\nher from expressing her emotion, she concealed her joy in an affectation\nof extreme cheerfulness, while great tears fell upon her faded cheeks.\nCaroline and the Marquis perceived these tears at the same moment, and\nher troubled look seemed to ask of him whether the Marchioness was\nconcealing joy or suffering. The Marquis quieted her solicitude by the\nsame means in which it had been conveyed; and the Duke, detecting this\nmute, rapid dialogue, smiled with a sort of good-natured malice. Neither\nCaroline nor the Marquis paid attention to this smile. There was too\nmuch good faith in their mutual sympathy. Caroline still held to her\ndislike and distrust of the Duke. She continued to grudge him the power\nof being so amiable and of appearing so good. She thought indeed that\nMadame de D---- had slightly exaggerated his waywardness; but feeling,\nin spite of herself, a vague fear, she avoided seeing him, and even in\nhis presence forced herself to forget his face. When the dessert was\nbrought in and the servants had retired, the conversation became a\nlittle more intimate. Caroline asked timidly of the Marchioness if she\ndid not think the clock was slow.\n\n\"No, no, not yet, dear child,\" kindly replied the old lady.\n\nCaroline understood that she was to remain till they left the table.\n\n\"So, my good friends,\" said the Marchioness, addressing her sons, \"you\nbreakfasted together in the Bois?\"\n\n\"Like Orestes and Pylades,\" answered the Duke, \"and you could n\'t\nimagine, dear mother, how fine it all was. And then I made a delightful\ndiscovery there, namely, that I have a charming brother. O, the word\nseems frivolous to you when applied to him; very well, I at least do not\nunderstand it in its trivial sense. The charm of the understanding is\noccasionally the charm of the heart, and my brother has them both.\"\n\nThe Marchioness smiled again, but she soon became thoughtful; a cloud\npassed athwart her mind. \"Gaëtan should be pained to receive his\nbrother\'s sacrifice,\" she thought; \"he takes it too lightly; perhaps he\nhas lost his pride. Heavens! that would be fatal to him.\"\n\nUrbain saw this cloud and hastened to dissipate it. \"For my part,\" he\nsaid, addressing his mother cheerfully and tenderly, \"I will not say in\nreturn that my brother is more charming than I am, for that is too\napparent; but I will say that I have also made a discovery, which is\nthat he has admirable and serious depths in his nature, and an\nunalterable respect for all that is true. Yes,\" he added, in instinctive\nreply to the profoundly astonished look of Caroline, \"there is in him a\nveritable candor which no one suspects, and which I have never before\nfully appreciated.\"\n\n\"My children,\" said the Marchioness, \"it does me good to hear you speak\nthus of each other; you touch my pride in the most sensitive place, and\nI am really led to believe that you are both right.\"\n\n\"As far as it concerns me,\" rejoined the Duke, \"you think so because you\nare the best of mothers; but you are blind. I am good for nothing at\nall, and the sad smile of Mlle de Saint-Geneix says plainly enough that\nyou and my brother are both deceiving yourselves.\"\n\n\"What! I smiled!\" cried Caroline, in stupefaction; \"have I looked sad?\nI could take my oath that I have not raised my eyes from this decanter,\nand that I have been meditating profoundly upon the qualities of\ncrown-glass.\"\n\n\"Do not fancy we believe,\" returned Gaëtan, \"that your thoughts are\nalways absorbed by household cares. I believe that they are frequently\nelevated far above the region of decanters, and that you judge of men\nand things from a very high stand-point.\"\n\n\"I allow myself to judge no one, your Grace.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for those who are not worth the exercise of your\njudgment. They could but gain by knowing it, however severe it might be.\nI myself, for instance, like to be judged by women. From their mouths I\nlike a frank condemnation better than the silence of disdain or of\nmistrust. I regard women as the only beings really capable of\nappreciating our failings or our good qualities.\"\n\n\"But, Madame de Villemer,\" said Caroline to the Marchioness in a\ndistressed manner which was sportively assumed, \"please tell his Grace\nthe Duke that I have not the honor of knowing him at all, and that I am\nnot here to continue in my head the portraits of La Bruyère.\"\n\n\"Dear child,\" replied the Marchioness, \"you are here to be a sort of\nadopted daughter, to whom everything is permitted, because we are aware\nof your fine discretion and your perfect modesty. Do not hesitate\ntherefore to answer my son, and do not be disturbed by his friendly\nattempt to tease you. He knows as well as I do who you are, and he will\nnever be wanting in the respect which is your due.\"\n\n\"This time, mother, I accept the compliment,\" said the Duke, in a tone\nof entire frankness. \"I have the profoundest respect for every pure,\ngenerous, and devoted woman, and consequently for Mlle de Saint-Geneix\nin particular.\"\n\nCaroline did not blush, or stammer the thanks of a prude governess. She\nlooked the Duke squarely in the eyes, saw that he was not at all mocking\nher, and answered him with kindness,--\n\n\"Why, then, your Grace, having so generous an opinion of me, do you\nsuppose that I permit myself to have a bad one of you?\"\n\n\"O, I have my reasons,\" answered the Duke; \"I will tell them to you when\nyou know me better.\"\n\n\"Well, but why not now?\" said the Marchioness; \"it would be the\npreferable way.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" rejoined the Duke. \"It is an anecdote. I will tell it. Day\nbefore yesterday I was alone in your drawing-room, waiting for you,\nmother mine. I was musing in a corner, and finding myself comfortably\nseated upon one of your little sofas,--I had that morning been training\nan unruly horse and was as tired as an ox,--I was meditating upon the\ndestiny of cappadine seats in general, as Mlle de Saint-Geneix was just\nmeditating upon that of crown-glass, and I said to myself, \'How\nastonished these sofas and easy-chairs would be to find themselves in a\nstable or in a cattle-shed! And how troubled those beautiful ladies in\nrobes of satin who are coming here directly would certainly be, if in\nthe place of these luxurious seats they should find nothing but\nlitter!\'\"\n\n\"But your revery hasn\'t common sense in it,\" said the Marchioness,\nlaughing.\n\n\"That\'s true,\" rejoined the Duke. \"Those were the thoughts of a man\nslightly intoxicated.\"\n\n\"What do you say, my son?\"\n\n\"Nothing very improper, dear mother. I came home hungry, weak, bruised,\nalready intoxicated with the open air. You know that water does not\nagree with me. I cannot slake my thirst, and in making the attempt I got\nfuddled,--that \'s all. You know too that it lasts me but a quarter of an\nhour at most, and that I have sense enough to keep myself quiet the\nnecessary time. That is why, instead of coming to kiss your hand during\nyour dessert, I slipped into the drawing-room, there to recover my\nsenses.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the Marchioness, \"slip over this confusion of your\nsenses, and let us have the point of your story.\"\n\n\"But that\'s just what I am coming to,\" rejoined the Duke, \"as you shall\nsee.\"\n\nAs he took up again the thread of his discourse with more or less\ndifficulty, Caroline could see that the Duke was in exactly the same\nstate of mind as that of which he was telling, and that his mother\'s\nheady wines had probably for some moments been responsible for his\nprolixity. Very soon, however, he overcame the slight disorder of his\nideas, and continued with a grace which was really perfect.\n\n\"I was a little absent-minded, I will confess, but not at all besotted.\nOn the contrary, I had poetical visions. From the litter scattered on\nthe floor by my imagination, I saw a thousand odd figures arise. They\nwere all women, some attired as for an old-fashioned court ball, others\nas for a Flemish peasant festival; the former embarrassed by contact of\ntheir crinoline and laces with the fresh straw, which impeded their\nsteps and wounded their feet; the latter in short dresses, shod in great\nwooden shoes, which tramped lustily over the litter, while their wearers\nlaughed till their mouths were opened wellnigh from ear to ear, at the\nodd appearance of the others.\n\n\"With regard to this side of the picture, it was, as the canvases of\nRubens have been called, the festival of flesh. Large hands, red cheeks,\npowerful shoulders, very prominent noses upon blooming faces, still with\nadmirable eyes, and a sort of cappadine attraction like your sofas and\neasy-chairs, which had undergone this magic transformation. I cannot\notherwise explain to myself the point of departure of my hallucination.\n\n\"These splendid, great strapping women abandoned themselves entirely to\na light-hearted joy; jumped up a foot in the air and came down again, to\nmake the pendants of the candelabra vibrate, some of them rolling upon\nthe straw, and getting up again with empty wheat-ears tangled in their\nhair of reddened gold. Opposite these the princesses of the fan\nattempted a stately dance without being able to accomplish it. The\nstraws arrayed themselves against their furbelows, the heat of the\natmosphere caused the paint to fall off, the powder trickled down upon\ntheir shoulders, and left the meagreness of their visages confessed; a\nmortal anguish was depicted in their expressive eyes. Evidently they\nfeared the shining of the sun upon their counterfeit charms, and saw\nwith fury the reality of life ready to triumph over them.\"\n\n\"Well, well, my son,\" said the Marchioness, \"where are you wandering,\nand what signifies all this? Have you undertaken the panegyric of\nviragos?\"\n\n\"I have undertaken nothing at all,\" replied the Duke; \"I relate; I am\ninventing nothing. I was under the empire of that vision, and I have no\nidea into what reflections it would have led me, if I had not heard a\nwoman singing close by me--\"\n\nGaëtan sang very pleasantly the rustic words of which he had faithfully\nretained the air, and Caroline began to laugh, remembering that she had\nsung that refrain of her province before perceiving the Duke in the\ndrawing-room.\n\nThe Duke continued: \"Then I arose, and my vision was completely\ndissipated. There was no more straw upon the floor; the plump chairs and\nsofas with wooden legs were no longer girls in wooden shoes from the\npoultry yard; the slender candelabra, with their bulging ornaments, were\nno longer thin women in hoop-petticoats. I was quite alone in the\nlighted apartment, and had completely come to my senses; but I heard the\nsinging of a village air in a style altogether rustic and true and\ncharming, with a freshness of voice, too, of which mine certainly can\ngive you no idea. \'What!\' cried I to myself, \'a peasant, a peasant girl\nin the drawing-room of my mother!\' I kept still, hardly breathing, and\nthe peasant girl appeared. She passed before me twice without seeing me,\nwalking quickly and almost touching me with her dress of pearl-gray\nsilk.\"\n\n\"Ah, that,\" said the Marchioness,--\"that then was Caroline?\"\n\n\"It was somebody unknown,\" rejoined the Duke; \"a singular peasant girl,\nyou will agree, for she was dressed like a modest person, and of the\nbest society. About her head she wore nothing but the glory of her own\nyellow hair, and she showed neither her arms nor her shoulders; but I\nsaw her neck of snow, and her nice little hand, and feet too, for she\ndid not have on wooden shoes.\"\n\nCaroline, a little annoyed at the description of her person by this\nveteran Lovelace, looked toward the Marquis as if in protest. She was\nsurprised to find a certain anxiety expressed in his face, and he\navoided her look with a slight contraction of his brows.\n\nThe Duke, from whom nothing escaped, proceeded: \"This adorable\napparition struck me all the more that it recalled to my eyes the two\ntypes of my dispelled vision; that is, she preserved all that made the\nmerit of the one or the other: nobleness of bearing and freshness of\nmanners, delicacy of features, and the glow of health. She was a queen\nand a shepherdess in the same person.\"\n\n\"That is a picture which does not flatter,\" said the Marchioness, \"but\nwhich, exposed face to face with its original, lacks perhaps a lightness\nof touch. Ah, my son, may you not again be a little--over-excited?\"\n\n\"You ordered me to speak,\" rejoined the Duke. \"If I speak too much, make\nme keep still.\"\n\n\"No,\" was the quick remark of Caroline, who observed a queer,\nhalf-suspicious look upon the face of the Marquis, and who was anxious\nthat nothing vague should be left about her first interview with the\nDuke. \"I do not recognize the original of the picture, and I wait for\nhis Grace the Duke to make her speak a little.\"\n\n\"I have a good memory and I shall invent nothing,\" rejoined he. \"Carried\naway by a sudden, irresistible sympathy, I spoke to this young lady from\nthe country. Her voice, her look, her neat, frank replies, her air of\ngoodness, of real innocence,--the innocence of the heart,--won me to\nsuch a degree that I told her of my esteem and respect at the end of\nfive minutes as if I had known her all my life, and I felt myself\njealous of her esteem as if she had been my own sister. Is that the\ntruth this time, Mlle de Saint-Geneix?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of your private sentiments, your Grace,\" replied\nCaroline; \"but you seemed to me so affable that it never crossed my mind\nyou could be tender in your cups, and that I was very grateful for your\nkindness. I see now that I must put a lower estimate upon it, and that\nthere was a trifle of irony in the whole.\"\n\n\"And in what do you see that, if you please?\"\n\n\"In the exaggerated praise with which you seem to try to excite my\nvanity; but I protest against it, your Grace, and perhaps it would have\nbeen more generous in you not to have commenced the attack upon a person\nso inoffensive and of so humble a quality as I am.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" said the Duke, turning toward his brother, who appeared to\nbe thinking upon an entirely different subject, and who, nevertheless,\nheard everything, as if in his own despite; \"she persists in suspecting\nme and in regarding my respect as an injury. Come now, Marquis, you have\nbeen telling her naughty things of me?\"\n\n\"That is not a habit of mine,\" answered the Marquis, with the gentleness\nof truth.\n\n\"Well, then,\" continued the Duke, \"I know who has ruined me in the\nopinion of Mlle de Saint-Geneix. It is an old lady whose gray hairs are\nturning to a slaty blue, and whose hands are so thin that her rings have\nto be hunted up in the sweepings every morning. She talked about me to\nMlle de Saint-Geneix for a quarter of an hour the other evening, and\nwhen I sought again the kindly look which had made my heart young, I did\nnot find it, and I do not find it now. You see. Marquis, there is no\nother way. Ah! but why are you so silent? You commenced my eulogy, and\nMlle de Saint-Geneix seems to have confidence in you. If you would just\ncommence again.\"\n\n\"My children,\" said the Marchioness, \"you can resume the discussion\nanother time. I have to dress, and I want to say something to you before\nany one comes to interrupt us. The clock is perhaps a few minutes slow.\"\n\n\"I think, indeed, that it is very slow,\" observed Caroline, rising; and,\nleaving the Duke and the Marquis to help their mother to her apartment,\nthe young lady went quickly to the drawing-room. She expected to find\nvisitors there, for the dinner had been prolonged a little more than\nusual; but no one had yet arrived, and, instead of tripping lightly\nabout, singing as she went, she seated herself thoughtfully by the fire.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nCaroline in her own despite commenced to find something galling in her\nsituation. She had endeavored not to think at all about the species of\ndomestic service which she had heroically accepted. No one, indeed,\ncould have been less fitted for this complete surrender of the will. She\nfelt shocked by the obstinate or affected attention paid her by the Duke\nd\'Aléria, and she considered herself constrained to hide her impatience\nand disdain. \"In my sister\'s house,\" she said to herself, \"I should not\nbe obliged to endure the compliments of this person. I should put an end\nto them with a single word. He would think me a prude, but that would\nmake no difference. He would be sent off, and all would be said. Here I\nmust be sprightly and polite, like a lady of society, look upon the\nlight side of everything, see nothing offensive in the gallantry of a\nlibertine. I must guess the science of the women who are broken in to\nthis kind of life. If I am as brusk with him as my frankness would lead\nme to be, the Duke would get a spite at me; he would calumniate me to\nrevenge himself, and perhaps to have me sent away. Sent away! Yes, in my\nposition, one is liable to be surprised by any vile plot, and dismissed\nwithout more ceremony than is observed with the humblest servant. These\nare the dangers and the insults to which I am exposed. I did wrong to\ncome here. Madame d\'Arglade never told me about this Duke, and I have\nbeen believing in an impossibility.\"\n\nCaroline was not of an irresolute spirit. From the moment that the\nthought of going away had occurred to her, she began to cast about in\nher mind for some other way of supporting her sister. She had received\nan advance from the Marchioness, and it was necessary to find elsewhere\nanother advance by which to return it, if the conduct of the Duke should\nnot permit of her remaining with his mother till the time paid for by\nthe little sum sent to Camille had been duly served. Thus Caroline came\nto think of the few hundreds of francs offered her by her nurse, whose\nletter received that morning was yet in her pocket. She now read that\nartless and motherly letter again, and, thinking how great a benefaction\ncan go with the unpretending charity of the poor, she felt herself once\nmore deeply touched and she wept.\n\nThe Marquis entered and found her wiping her eyes. She folded up the\nletter again and put it unaffectedly back in her pocket, without\nattempting to conceal her emotion under an assumption of cheerfulness.\nNevertheless she remarked a shade of irony upon M. de Villemer\'s face,\nwhich usually was so kind. She looked at him as if asking whom he wanted\nto ridicule, and he, becoming slightly embarrassed, hesitated for words,\nand ended by saying quite simply, \"You were weeping?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"but not from sorrow.\"\n\n\"You have received good news?\"\n\n\"No, a proof of friendship.\"\n\n\"You ought to receive such things frequently.\"\n\n\"There are testimonies more or less sincere.\"\n\n\"You seem to be in a doubting mood to-day; you are not every day so\nmistrustful.\"\n\n\"No, not every day; I am not naturally distrustful. Are you, M. de\nVillemer?\"\n\nUrbain was always a little startled when questioned directly about\nhimself. It cost him an effort to interrogate others, and to be\nquestioned in return caused him a species of trouble.\n\n\"I,\" he answered, after a moment\'s hesitation,--\"I do not know. I should\nbe very much at a loss how to tell you what I am--at this moment\nespecially.\"\n\n\"Yes, you appear to be preoccupied,\" rejoined Caroline; \"do not make an\neffort to speak to me, M. de Villemer.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I want--I would like to speak with you; but it is a very\ndelicate matter. I do not know how to begin.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed? You disquiet me a little. And yet it seems to me that it\nwill be well for me to know what you are thinking about just now.\"\n\n\"Well--yes, you are right. Quick, then, for we may be interrupted at any\nmoment. I shall not have to say much, I hope, to make you understand me.\nI love my brother; to-day especially I love him tenderly. I am certain\nof his sincerity; but his imagination is very lively,--you have just had\nevidence of that. In short, if he has been a little too persistent in\nhis endeavor to change the unfavorable impression of him which perhaps\nyou may not have at all, and which, in any case, he does not merit but\nto a certain degree, I would like to have you promise to speak of it to\nmy mother and to my mother only. Do not think it strange or impertinent\nin me to volunteer my advice. I have such a desire to see my mother\nhappy, and I see so clearly that you already contribute largely to her\nhappiness, the society of an intelligent and worthy person is so\nnecessary to her, and it would probably be so impossible for her to\nreplace you, that I would, knowing you to be happy and satisfied in your\nposition, like to believe that you will always be with her. And now you\nknow the only thing upon which I have been preoccupied.\"\n\n\"I thank you for this explanation, M. de Villemer,\" replied Caroline,\n\"and I will confess I expected that your integrity would some day\nconsent to give it.\"\n\n\"My integrity? But my whole explanation consists in this: my brother is\nlight-hearted, amiable, and if his gayety has become painful to you, my\nmother, able to restrain him and possessing in that respect an\nascendency over him which I cannot have, would on the one hand know how\nto reassure you, and how on the other, to keep my brother\'s vivacity of\nspeech within proper bounds.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, we understand each other,\" rejoined Caroline; \"but we are not\nquite of the same opinion as to the means of curing the--the amiable\nsportiveness of his Grace, the Duke. You think that Madame the\nMarchioness will be able to preserve me from it; and I believe that\nbetween an adored son and a tender mother no one can or ought to carry\ncomplaints. Before certain judges we are never right. I have been\nthinking exactly of this situation, and I foresaw with real sorrow that\na moment might come when I should be compelled--\"\n\n\"To go away from us, to leave my mother?\" asked the Marquis, with a\nsudden eagerness, which he repressed immediately. \"That was exactly what\nI feared. If that idea has already entered your mind, I am very much\ndistressed; but I do not believe it is well founded. Be careful not to\nbe unjust. My brother was very much excited today. A particular\ncircumstance, a family matter having much to do with the feelings, had\nalmost overcome him this morning. This evening he was happy, merry, and\ntherefore impulsive. When you know him better--\"\n\nThe bell was heard to ring. The Marquis started. Friends arrived. He was\ncompelled to leave in suspense many things which he would have liked to\nsay and not to say. He hastened to add, \"Now, in the name of Heaven, in\nthe name of my mother, do not be in a hurry to take a step which would\nbe so sad, so grievous to her. If I dared, if I had the right, I would\npray you to decide nothing without consulting me--\"\n\n\"The respect to which your character gives you the right,\" replied\nCaroline, \"gives you also the right to counsel me, and I do not hesitate\nto promise you what you have been kind enough to ask.\"\n\nThe Marquis had no time to express his gratitude. They were no longer\nalone in the drawing-room; but there was an extraordinary eloquence in\nhis look, and Caroline found again in it the confidence and affection\nwhich had appeared under a cloud at the commencement of their interview.\nThe eyes of the Marquis had that remarkable beauty which can spring only\nfrom an ardent soul joined to great purity of thought. They were the\nonly expression of his inner nature which his timidity did not succeed\nin paralyzing. Caroline understood him now, and nothing confused,\nnothing troubled her in the language of those clear eyes which she\nquestioned frequently as the keepers of her conscience and the guides of\nher conduct.\n\nCaroline really had a veneration for this man, whose character every one\nappreciated, but whose intelligence and delicacy every one did not\nfathom or divine. In spite, however, of the satisfaction in which their\nconversation had just ended, she sought in going over it again to\nherself to understand it in all its bearings. She thought quickly, and,\nwhile going about the drawing-room to do the honors,--within the limits\nof the favor and reserve which had been imposed upon her, and whose\nexact lines she had easily observed from the first,--she demanded of\nherself why the Marquis had seemed to waver among two or three\nsuccessive ideas in speaking to her. At first he had appeared disposed\nto reproach her for believing in the flatteries of the Duke, then he had\ngiven her a friendly warning against the continuance of these attacks,\nand finally, as soon as she had expressed her displeasure at them, he\nhimself had hastened to allay it. She had never seen him irresolute,\nand, if his language was frequently timid, his convictions were never\nso. \"It must be,\" she thought, \"that in the first place he considered me\nimprudent, and his brother likely to take advantage of the fact; in the\nsecond place, it must be that I am really more necessary to his\nmuch-loved mother, already, than I could have believed. At all events,\nthere is a hidden something in this which I cannot understand, and which\nI suppose he will explain to me hereafter. Whatever it may be, I am\nfree. Five hundred francs will not bind me a day, an hour, in a\nhumiliating position. I have not yet sent off my answer to Justine.\"\n\nWe see how far the honest, clear conscience of Mlle de Saint-Geneix was\nfrom seeking in the constrained silence of the Marquis an unbecoming\nsentiment or an instinct of jealousy. If the Marquis had been questioned\nat that moment, could he have answered with so much assurance, \"With me\nit is only a respectful esteem and filial solicitude?\"\n\nAt that moment, in point of fact, M. de Villemer was by no means pleased\nwith his brother, and listened to him with an impatience which was\npainful enough. The Duke, having entered the drawing-room with his\nmother, had come and seated himself near him behind the piano, an\nisolated and protected place, which was a favorite with the Marquis;\nhere then the Duke began the following conversation, speaking in a low\nvoice but in a very lively manner:--\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you saw her alone just now; did you speak to her of\nme?\"\n\n\"But,\" replied M. de Villemer, \"what singular persistency!\"\n\n\"There is nothing singular about it,\" rejoined the Duke, as if he were\ncontinuing the details of a confidential disclosure already made. \"I am\nstruck, touched, taken. I am in love if you will. Yes, in love with her,\nupon my honor! It is no joke. Are you going to reproach me, when for the\nfirst time in my life I make you my confidant? Was that not agreed upon\nthis morning? Did we not swear to tell each other everything, and to be\neach other\'s best friend? I asked you whether you had any feeling for\nMlle de Saint-Geneix; you answered me \'No,\' very seriously. Do not,\ntherefore, think it extraordinary that I ask you to serve me with her.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied the Marquis, \"I have done exactly the contrary of\nwhat you would have me to do. I told her to take nothing you said too\nseriously.\"\n\n\"Ah, traitor!\" cried the Duke, with a gayety whose frankness was as a\nreparation for his former prejudices against his brother, \"that is the\nway you serve your friends. Trust in Pylades! At the first call he\nresigns; he whistles at my dreams, and gives my hopes to the winds. But\nwhat do you suppose will become of me, if you abandon me in this\nfashion?\"\n\n\"For that kind of service I have n\'t even common sense, you see very\nplainly.\"\n\n\"That\'s so; at the first difficulty you renounce it. Well, but I am\nmaddened. I have driven from my heart all that is not you, and none but\nyou shall hear of my new flames.\"\n\n\"With regard to the present one at least, will you pledge me your\nhonor?\"\n\n\"Ah! you are in great fear lest I compromise her?\"\n\n\"That would give me serious pain.\"\n\n\"Bah! Come now, why?\"\n\n\"Because she is proud, sensitive perhaps, and would leave my mother, who\ndotes upon her,--have you not observed that?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it is that very thing which has turned my head. She must\nreally be a girl of great cleverness and a deal of heart. Our mother has\nsuch perfect tact. This evening, in taking me to task a little for what\nshe considered my attempt at teasing, she held the sugarplum very high,\nsaying, \'Your conduct toward Caroline was neither proper nor agreeable.\nShe is a person of whom you are not permitted to think.\' The deuce! A\nfellow always has the right to dream; that certainly harms no one. But\nsee though how pretty she is; how alive in the midst of all those\nplastered women! One can look at the contour of her face in the nearest\nand most trying light; one will not see there those dull, sticky lines\nwhich make the others look like plaster casts. It is true she is too\npretty to be any one\'s young-lady companion. My mother can never keep\nher; every one will fall in love with her, and if she continues to be\nwell-behaved some one will want to marry her.\"\n\n\"Then,\" rejoined the Marquis, \"you cannot think of her.\"\n\n\"Why so, pray?\" demanded the Duke. \"Am I not to-day a poor devil with\nnothing in the world? Is she not of good birth? Is not her reputation\nspotless? I should like to know what my mother would find to say against\nit,--she who already calls the young lady her daughter, and who wishes\nus to respect her as if she were our own sister.\"\n\n\"You, sir, carry your enthusiasm or your joke to great lengths,\" said\nthe Marquis, stunned by what he heard.\n\n\"Good,\" thought the Duke, \"he has forgotten his brotherly _thee_ and\n_thou_; he calls me \'you, sir.\'\"\n\nAnd he continued to maintain with astonishing seriousness that he was\nquite capable of marrying Mlle de Saint-Geneix, if there were no other\nmeans of winning her. \"I should prefer to run away with her,\" he added;\n\"that would better accord with my usual way of doing things; but I no\nlonger have the means with which to run away with her, and now my\nlaundress herself would not trust herself to my hands. Besides, it is\ntime to break with my entire past. I have said it to you, and it is\ndone, because I have said it. Starting from to-day,--a complete\nreformation along the whole line. You are going to see a new man,--a man\nwhom I myself do not know, and who indeed is going to astonish me; but\nthat man, I feel now, is capable of all things, all, even to believe, to\nlove, and to marry. So good evening, brother; those are my last words;\nif you do not repeat them to Mlle de Saint-Geneix, it is because you\nwish to do nothing to aid me in my conversion.\"\n\nThe Duke withdrew, leaving his brother stupefied,--divided between the\nnecessity of believing him sincere in his momentary passion and the\nindignity of being solicited as an accomplice in a flagrant libertinism.\n\n\"But no,\" he said to himself, going to his own apartments; \"that was all\nmerely his gayety, his trifling, his folly,--or it was still the wine.\nNevertheless, this morning in the grove he interrogated me about\nCaroline with a surprising insistence, and that, too, almost in the\nmidst of my confidences concerning my past, which he received with\ngenuine emotion, with tears in his eyes. What kind of a man then is this\nbrother of mine? Not twelve hours ago, he thought of killing himself. He\nhated me, he detested himself. Then I believed I had won his heart. He\nsobbed in my arms. All day long it has been the extreme of impulse and\ndevotion, winning tenderness and goodwill; and to-night I no longer know\nwhat it is. Has his reason received some shock in the uncurbed life\nwhich he has hitherto led, or did he indeed make sport of me all the\nfore part of the day? Am I the dupe of my need to love? Shall I have\ncause for bitter repentance, or have I in fact taken upon myself the\ntask of caring for a diseased brain?\"\n\nIn his fright the Marquis accepted this latter supposition as the less\nappalling; but another anguish was mingled with it. The Marquis felt\nhimself bruised and irritated by a sentiment which he did not avow to\nhimself, and to which he would not so much as give a name. He set\nhimself to work and worked badly. He went to bed and slept still worse.\n\nAs for the Duke, he innocently rubbed his hands. \"I have succeeded,\"\nsaid he to himself; \"I have found the proper reaction against his\ndespair. Poor, dear brother! I have turned his head, I have aroused his\nfeelings, I have excited his jealousy. He is in love. He will be cured,\nand he will live. For passion there is no remedy but passion. It is not\nmy mother who would have found that out, and if she is opposed to so\nhumble a match, she will forgive me for making it on the day when she\nshall know that my brother would have died of his regrets and of his\nconstancy.\"\n\nThe Duke was not perhaps mistaken, and a wiser man could have been less\ningenious. He would have endeavored to lead the Marquis back to an\ninterest in life through the love of letters, through filial affection,\nthrough reason and duty,--things which were all excellent, but which the\ninvalid himself had long since vainly called to his aid. Now the Duke,\nfrom his point of view, imagined that he had rescued everything, and did\nnot foresee that with an exclusive nature like his brother\'s, the remedy\nmight soon become worse than the disease. The Duke, knowing human\nsusceptibility through himself, believed in a general susceptibility in\nwomen, and admitted no exceptions. According to his ideas, Caroline\nwould not make any struggle at all; he believed her already quite\ndisposed to love the Marquis. \"She is a good young woman,\" he said to\nhimself; \"not at all ambitious, and entirely disinterested. I judged her\nat the first glance, and my mother assures me that I am not mistaken.\nShe will yield through her need to love some one, and through\nallurement, too, for my brother has great attractions for an intelligent\nwoman. If she resists him awhile, it will be all the better; he will be\nso much the more attached to her. My mother will see nothing of this,\nand if she does see it, it will agitate her, it will occupy her too. She\nwill be good, she will preach the requirements of caste, and yield to\nendearment. These little domestic emotions will rescue her from the\ntedium which is her greatest torment.\"\n\nTo these heartless calculations the Duke gave himself up with perfect\ncandor. He grew tender himself over this sort of puerility which\noftentimes characterizes corruption as an exhaustion. He laughed to\nhimself as he regarded the beautiful victim already immolated, in\nimagination to his projects; and if any one had questioned him on the\nsubject, he would have answered with a laugh, that he was in the act of\narranging a romance after the manner of Florian, as a beginning to his\ncontemplated life of sentiment and innocence.\n\nHe remained in the drawing-room the whole evening, and found the means\nto speak to Caroline without being overheard. \"My mother has been\nscolding me,\" he said. \"It appears that I have been absurd with you. I\ndid not suspect such a thing, I assure you, for I really wanted to prove\nto you my respect. In a word, my mother has made me pledge my honor that\nI will not think of making love to you, and I pledged it without\nhesitation. Are you quieted now?\"\n\n\"All the more that I have not thought of being disquieted.\"\n\n\"That\'s fortunate. Since my mother forced me into the rudeness of saying\nto a woman what we never say, even when we think it, let us be good\nfriends like two well-meaning people as we are, and let us be frank with\neach other to commence with. Promise me, then, no longer to speak ill of\nme to my brother.\"\n\n\"No longer? When, pray, have I spoken ill of you to him?\"\n\n\"You did not complain of my impertinence--there, this evening?\"\n\n\"I said that I dreaded your raillery, and that, if it continued, I\nshould go away; that is all.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" thought the Duke, \"they are already on better terms than I had\nhoped.\" He rejoined, \"If you think of quitting my mother on my account,\nit will condemn me to go away from her myself.\"\n\n\"That could not be thought of. A son giving place to a stranger!\"\n\n\"That nevertheless is what I have resolved to do, if I displease you and\nif I frighten you; but remain, and command me to be and do as you would\nwish. Ought I never to see you, never speak to you, not even salute\nyou?\"\n\n\"I exact no affectation in any sense whatever. You are too clever and\nexperienced not to have understood that I am not skilled enough in the\nartifices of speech to sustain any assault against you.\"\n\n\"You are too modest; but since you do not wish that the prescribed forms\nof admiration should mingle with those of respect, and since the\nattention, which it is so difficult for you not to awaken, alarms and\nafflicts you, be at ease; I consider it said and done: you will have no\nfurther cause, of complaint in me. I swear it by all that a man can hold\nsacred,--by my mother!\"\n\nAfter having thus made reparation for his fault and reassured Caroline,\nwhose going away would have foiled his plan, the Duke began to speak to\nher of Urbain with a veritable enthusiasm. Upon this point he was so\nthoroughly sincere, that Mlle de Saint-Geneix laid aside her prejudices.\nHer mind became calm again, and she hastened to write to Camille that\neverything was going well, that the Duke was much better than his\nreputation, and that, at all events, he had engaged upon his honor not\nto disturb her.\n\nDuring the month succeeding that day Caroline saw very little of M. de\nVillemer. He was obliged to be occupied with the details of settling his\nbrother\'s debts; then he absented himself. He told his mother that he\nwas going to Normandy to see a certain historical castle whose plan was\nnecessary for his work, and he set out in quite an opposite direction,\nconfiding to the Duke alone that he was going in the strictest incognito\nto see his son.\n\nAs for the Duke himself, he was very busy with the change of his\npecuniary position. He sold his horses, his furniture and personal\nproperty, discharged his lackeys, and came, at the request of his\nmother, to install himself provisionally, for economy\'s sake, in a suite\nof apartments between the ground floor and the first story of her hotel,\nwhich was going to be sold also, but with the reservation that the\nMarquis should remain for ten years the principal tenant, and that\nnothing should be changed in the apartments of his mother.\n\nUrbain himself had ascended to the third story and piled up his books in\na lodging more than modest, protesting that he had never been better\noff, and that he had a magnificent view of the Champs-Élysées. During\nhis absence the preparations for the departure to the country were made,\nand Mlle de Saint-Geneix wrote to her sister: \"I am counting the days\nwhich separate us from the blissful time when I can at last walk to my\nheart\'s content, and breathe a pure air. I have enough of flowers which\nfaint and die upon the mantels; I am thirsty for those which bloom in\nthe open fields.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nLETTER FROM THE MARQUIS DE VILLEMER\nTO THE DUKE D\'ALÉRIA.\n\nPOLIGNAC, _via_ LE PUY (HAUTE-LOIRE),\nMay 1, \'45.\n\nThe address I give you is a secret which I intrust to you, and which I\nam happy to intrust to you. If by any unforeseen accident I should\nchance to die, away from you, you would know that your first duty would\nbe to send hither and see that the child was not neglected by the people\nin whose charge I have placed him. These people do not know who I am;\nthey know neither my name nor my country; they are not aware even that\nthe child is mine. That these precautions are necessary, I have already\ntold you. M. de G---- clings to suspicions which would naturally lead\nhim to doubt the legitimacy of his daughter,--really his own,\nnevertheless. This fear was the torture of their unhappy mother, to whom\nI swore that the existence of Didier should be concealed until Laura\'s\nfortune had been assured. I have noticed more than once the uneasy\ncuriosity with which my movements have been watched. I cannot therefore\ncloud them too much in mystery.\n\nThis is my reason for placing my son so far away from me and in a\nprovince where having no other interests of any kind, I run less risk\nthan I should elsewhere of being betrayed through some accidental\nmeeting. The people with whom I have to deal give me every possible\nguaranty of their honesty, goodwill, and discretion, in the single fact\nthat they abstain from questioning or watching me. The nurse is the\nniece of Joseph, that good old servant whom we lost a year ago. It was\nhe who recommended her to me; but she, too, is in complete ignorance\nregarding me. She knows me by the name of \"Bernyer.\" The woman is young,\nhealthy, and good-humored, a simple peasant, but comfortably provided\nfor. I should fear that, in making her richer, I could not eradicate the\nparsimonious habits of the country, which, I perceive, are even more\ninveterate here than elsewhere; and I have held merely to this, that the\npoor child, while brought up in the true conditions of rustic\ndevelopment, should not have to suffer from an excess of these\nconditions; this excess having precisely the same effect upon children\nthat lack of sunlight produces upon plants.\n\nMy hosts, for I am writing this in their house, are farmers, having\ncharge of the enclosed grounds, within which rises, from a rocky\nplatform, one of the rudest of mediæval fortresses, the cradle of that\nfamily whose last representatives played such an unhappy part in the\nrecent vicissitudes of our monarchy. Their ancestors in this province\nplayed no less sad a one, and no less important to an age when the\nfeudal system had made the part of king very insignificant. It is not\nwithout interest for the historical work upon which I am engaged, to\ngather up the traditions here and to study the look and character of the\nold manor and the surrounding country; so I have not absolutely deceived\nmy mother in telling her that I was going to travel in \"search of\ninformation.\"\n\nThere is really much to be learned here in the very heart of our\nbeautiful France, which it is not fashionable to visit, and which\nconsequently still hides its shrines of poetry and its mines of science\nin inaccessible nooks. Here is a country without roads, without guides,\nwithout any facilities for locomotion, where every discovery must be\nconquered at the price of danger or fatigue. The inhabitants know as\nlittle about it as strangers. Their purely rural lives confine their\nideas of locality to a very limited horizon: on a stroll, then, it is\nimpossible to get any information, if you do not know the names and\nrelative situations of all the little straggling villages; indeed,\nwithout a very complete map to consult at every step, although I have\nbeen in this country three times in the two years of Didier\'s life here,\nI could find my way only in a straight line, a thing entirely out of the\nquestion over a soil cut up with deep ravines, crossed in every way by\nlofty walls of lava, and furrowed by numerous torrents.\n\nBut I need not go far to appreciate the wild and striking character of\nthe landscape. Nothing, my friend, can give you an idea of this basin of\nLe Puy with its picturesque beauty, and I can think of no place more\ndifficult to describe. It is not Switzerland, it is less terrible; it is\nnot Italy, it is more lovely; it is Central France with all its\nVesuviuses extinct and clothed with splendid vegetation; and yet it is\nneither Auvergne nor Limosin, with which you are familiar.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBut I have said enough to keep my promise and to give you some general\nidea of the country. My dear brother, you urged me to write a long\nletter, foreseeing that, in my lonely, sleepless hours, I should think\ntoo much about myself, my sad life, and my painful past, in the presence\nof this child who is sleeping yonder while I write! It is true that the\nsight of him reopens many wounds, and that it is doing me a kindness to\ncompel me to forget myself while generalizing my impressions. And yet I\nfind here powerful emotions, too, which are not without sweetness. Shall\nI close my letter before I have spoken of him? You see I hesitate; I\nfear I shall make you smile. You pretend to detest children. As for me,\nwithout feeling that repugnance I used formerly to shrink from coming in\ncontact with these little beings, whose helpless candor had something\nappalling to my mind. To-day I am totally changed in this regard, and\neven if you should laugh at me, I must still open my heart to you\nwithout reserve. Yes, yes, my friend, I must do it. That you may know me\nthoroughly, I ought to conquer my sensitiveness.\n\nWell, then, you must know I worship this child, and I see, that sooner\nor later, he will be my whole life and my whole aim. It is not duty\nalone that brings me to him, it is my own heart that cries out for him,\nwhen I have gone without seeing him for a certain length of time. He is\ncomfortable here, he wants for nothing, he is growing strong, he is\nbeloved. His adopted parents are excellent souls, and, as to caring for\nhim properly, I can see that their hearts are in the matter as well as\ntheir interests. They live in a part of the manor-house which yet\nremains standing and which has been suitably restored. They are neat and\npainstaking people, and they are bringing up the child within these\nruins, on the summit of the large rock, under a bright sky, and in a\npure and bracing atmosphere. The woman has lived in Paris; she has\ncorrect ideas as to the amount of energy and also of humoring that it\ntakes to manage a child more delicate, indeed, than her own children,\nbut with as good a constitution; so I need not feel anxious about\nanything, but can await the age when it will become necessary to care\nfor and form other material than the body. Well! I am ill at ease about\nhim just as soon as I am away from him. His existence then often seems\nlike an anxiety and a deep trouble in my life; but, when I see him\nagain, all fears vanish and all bitterness is allayed. What shall I say\nthen? I love him! I feel that he belongs to me and that I belong equally\nto him. I feel that he is mine, yes, mine, far more than his poor mother\never was; as his features and disposition become more marked, I seek\nvainly in him for something which may recall her to me, and this\nsomething does not seem to unfold. Contrary to the usual law which makes\nboys rather than girls inherit the traits of the mother, it is his\nfather that this child will resemble, if he continues, henceforth, to\ndevelop in the way he seems to be doing now. He has already my indolence\nand the unconquerable timidity of my earliest years, which my mother so\noften tells me about, and my quick, impulsive moments of unreserved\nconfidence, which made her, she says, forgive me and love me in spite of\nall. This year he has taken notice of my presence near him. He was\nafraid at first, but now he smiles and tries to talk. His smile and\nbroken words make me tremble; and when he takes my hand to walk, a\ncertain grateful feeling toward him, I cannot tell what, brings to my\neyes tears which I conceal with difficulty.\n\nBut this is enough, I do not want to appear too much of a child myself:\nI have told you this that you may no longer wonder why I refuse to\nlisten to your plans for me. My friend, you must never speak to me of\nlove or marriage. I have not store of happiness enough to bestow any\nupon a being that would be new to my life. My life itself is hardly\nsufficient for my duties, as I see clearly in the affection I have for\nDidier, for my mother, and for you. With this thirst for study, which so\noften becomes a fever in me, what time should I have for enlivening the\nleisure hours of a young woman eager for happiness and gayety? No, no,\ndo not think of it; and if the idea of such isolation is sometimes\nfearful at my age, help me to await the moment when it will be perfectly\nnatural. This will be my task for several years to come. Your affection,\nas you know, will make them seem fewer and shorter. Keep it for me,\nindulgent to my faults, generous even toward my confidence.\n\nP. S. I presume that my mother has left for Séval with Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix, and that you have accompanied them. If my mother is\nanxious about me, tell her you have heard from me and that I am still in\nNormandy.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe same day on which the Marquis wrote to his brother Caroline wrote to\nher sister, and sketched, after her own manner, the country where she\nwas.\n\n\nSÉVAL, near CHAMBON (CREUSE), May 1, \'45.\n\nAt last, my sister, we are here, and it is a terrestrial paradise. The\ncastle is old and small, but well arranged for comfort and picturesque\nenough. The park is sufficiently large, not any too well kept, and not\nin the English fashion--thank Heaven!--rich in fine old trees covered\nwith ivy, and in grasses running wild. The country is delightful. We are\nstill in Auvergne, in spite of the new boundaries, but very near to the\nold limits of La Marche, and within a league of a little city called\nChambon, through which we passed on our way to the castle. This little\ntown is very well situated. It is reached by a mountain ascent, or\nrather, through a cleft in a deep ravine; for mountain, properly\nspeaking, there is none. Leaving behind the broad plains of thin, moist\nsoil, covered with small trees and large bushes, you descend into a\nlong, winding gorge, which in some places enlarges into a valley. In the\nbottom of this ravine, which soon divides into branches, flow rivers of\npure crystal, not navigable, and rather torrents than rivers, although\nthey only whirl along, boiling a little, but threatening no danger. As\nfor myself, having never known anything but our great plains and wide,\nsmooth rivers, I am somewhat inclined to look upon all here as either\nhill or abyss; but the Marchioness, who has seen the Alps and the\nPyrenees, laughs at me, and pretends that all this is as insignificant\nas a table-cover. So I forbear to give you any enthusiastic description,\nlest I mislead your judgment; but the Marchioness, who cannot be accused\nof an undue love of nature, will never succeed in preventing me from\nbeing delighted with what I see.\n\nIt is a country of grasses and leafage, one continual cradle of verdure.\nThe river, which descends the ravine, is called the Vouèze, and then,\nuniting with the Tarde at Chambon, it becomes the Char, which, again at\nthe end of the first valley, is called the Cher, a stream that every one\nknows. For myself, I like the name Char (or car); it is excellent for a\nstream like this, which in reality rolls along at about the pace of a\ncarriage well under way down a gentle slope, where there is nothing to\nmake it jolt or jar unreasonably. The road also is straight and sanded\nlike a garden walk, lined too with magnificent beeches, through which\none can see outspread the natural meadows that are just now one carpet\nof flowers. O, these lovely meadows, my dear Camille! How little they\nresemble our artificial plains, where you always see the same plant on\nground prepared in regular beds! Here you feel that you are walking over\ntwo or three layers of vegetation, of moss, reeds, iris, a thousand\nkinds of grasses, some of them pretty, and others prettier still,\ncolumbines, forget-me-nots, and I know not what! There is everything;\nand they all come of their own accord, and they come always! It is not\nnecessary to turn over the ground once in every three or four years to\nexpose the roots to the air and to begin over again the everlasting\nharrowing which our indolent soil seems to need. And then, here, some of\nthe land is permitted to go to waste or poorly tilled, or so it seems;\nand in these abandoned nooks Nature heartily enjoys making herself wild\nand beautiful. She shoots forth at you great briers which seem\ninexhaustible and thistles that look like African plants, they flaunt\nsuch large coarse leaves, slashed and ragged, to be sure, but admirable\nin design and effect.\n\nWhen we had crossed the valley,--I am speaking of yesterday,--we climbed\na very rugged and precipitous ascent. The weather was damp, misty,\ncharming. I asked leave to walk, and, at the height of five or six\nhundred feet, I could see the whole of this lovely ravine of verdure.\nThe far-off trees were already crowding toward the brink of the water at\nmy feet, while from point to point in the distance rustic mills and\nsluices filled the air with the muffled cadences of their sounds.\nMingled with all this were the notes of a bagpipe from I know not where,\nand which kept repeating a simple but pleasing air, till I had heard\nmore than enough of it. A peasant who was walking in front of me began\nto sing the words, following and carrying along the air, as if he wanted\nto help the musician through with it. The words, without rhyme or\nreason, seemed so curious that I will give them to you--\n\n\n\"Alas! how hard are the rocks!\nThe sun melts them not,--\nThe sun, _nor yet the moon!_\nThe lad who would love\nSeeketh his pain.\"\n\n\nThere is always something mysterious in peasant songs, and the music, as\ndefective as the verses, is also mysterious, often sad and inducing\nrevery. For myself, condemned as I am to do my dreaming at lightning\nspeed, since my life does not belong to me, I was forcibly impressed by\nthis couplet, and I asked myself many times why \"the moon,\" at least,\ndid not melt the rocks; did this mean that, by night as well as by day,\nthe grief of the peasant lover is as heavy as his mountains?\n\nOn the top of this hill, which appropriately bristles with these large\nrocks, so cruelly hard,--the Marchioness says they are small as grains\nof sand, but then I never happened to see any such beautiful sand,--we\nentered upon a road narrower than the highway, and, after walking a\nlittle way amid enclosures of wooded grounds, we found ourselves at the\nentrance of the castle, which is entirely shaded by the trees, and not\nimposing in appearance; but on the other side it commands the whole\nbeautiful ravine that we had just passed through. You can see the deep\ndeclivity, with its rocks and its bushes, the river too with its trees,\nits meadows, its mills, and the winding outlet through which it flows,\nbetween banks growing more and more narrow and precipitous. There is in\nthe park a very pretty spring, which rises there, to fall in spray along\nthe rocks. The garden is well in bloom. In the lower court there is a\nlot of animals which I am permitted to manage. I have a delightful room,\nvery secluded, with the finest view of all; the library is the largest\napartment in the house. The drawing-room of the Marchioness, in its\nfurniture and arrangement, calls to mind the one in Paris; but it is\nlarger, not so deadening to sound, and one can breathe in it. In short,\nI am well, I am content, I feel myself reviving; I rise at daybreak, and\nuntil the Marchioness appears, which, thank Heaven, is no earlier here\nthan in Paris, I am going to belong to myself in a most agreeable\nfashion. O, how free I shall be to walk, and write to you, and think of\nyou! Alas! if I only had one of the children here, Lili or Charley, what\ndelightful and instructive walks we could take together! But it is in\nvain for me to fall in love with all the handsome darlings that I meet,\nfor it does not last. A moment after I compare them with yours, and I\nfeel that yours will have no serious rivals in my affections, and in the\nmidst of my rejoicing at being in the country, comes the thought that I\nam farther from you than I was before!--and when shall I see you again?\n\n\"Alas! how hard are the rocks!\" But it\'s of no use to struggle against\nall of those which cumber the lives of poor people like us. I must do my\nduty and become attached to the Marchioness. Loving her is not\ndifficult. Every day she is more kind to me; she is really almost like a\nmother to me, and her fancy for petting and spoiling me makes me forget\nmy real position. We expected to find the Marquis on our arrival, since\nhe promised to meet his mother here. It cannot be long before he comes.\nAs for the Duke, he will be here, I think, next week. Let us hope that\nhe will be as civil to me in the country as he has been lately in Paris,\nand not oblige me to show my temper.\n\n\nAt another time Caroline reported to her sister the opinions of the\nMarchioness on country life.\n\n\"\'My dear child,\' said she to me not long since, \'in order to love the\ncountry one must love the earth stupidly, or nature unreasonably. There\nis no mean between brutal stupidity and enthusiastic folly. Now you know\nthat if I have anything excitable or even sanguine in my composition, it\nis for the concerns of society rather than for what is governed by the\nlaws of Nature, which are always the same. Those laws are the work of\nGod, so they are good and beautiful. Man can change nothing in them. His\ncontrol, his observation, his admiration, even his descriptive\neloquence, add nothing at all to them. When you go into ecstasies over\nan apple-tree in bloom, I do not think you are wrong; I think, on the\ncontrary, that you are very right, but it seems to me hardly worth while\nto praise the apple-tree which does not hear you, which does not bloom\nto please you, and which will bloom neither the more nor the less, if\nyou say nothing to it. Be assured that when you exclaim, \"How beautiful\nis the spring!\" it is just the same as if you said, \"The spring is the\nspring!\" Well, then, yes, it is warm in summer because God has made the\nsun. The river is clear because it is running water, and it is running\nwater because its bed is inclined. It is beautiful because there is in\nall this a great harmony; but if it had not this harmony, all the beauty\nwould not exist.\'\n\n\"Thus you see the Marchioness is nothing of an artist, and that she has\narguments at her service for not understanding what she does not feel;\nbut in this is she not like the rest of the world, and are we not all\nacting like her, with respect to any faculty we may happen to lack?\n\n\"As she was thus talking, seated on a garden bench much fatigued with\nthe \'exercise\' she had taken,--namely, a hundred paces on a sanded\nwalk,--a peasant came to the garden gate to sell fish to the cook, who\nwas bargaining with him. I recognized this peasant as the one who had\nwalked before me on the day of our arrival, singing the song about the\n\'hard rocks.\' \'What are you thinking of?\' asked the Marchioness, who saw\nthat I was observing him.\n\n\"\'I am thinking,\' I replied, \'of watching that stout fellow. It is no\nlonger an apple-tree or a river, you see, and he has a peculiar\ncountenance, with which I have been struck.\'\n\n\"\'How, pray?\'\n\n\"\'Why, if I were not afraid to repeat a modern word of which you seem to\nhave a horror, I should say that this man has character.\'\n\n\"\'How do you know? Is it because he is obstinate about the price of his\nfish? Ah! that\'s it; but pardon me. Character! the word, you see, has\nbecome a pun in my mind. I have forgotten to think of it as used in\nliterature--or art. A piece of dress goods, a bench, a kettle, have\ncharacter now; that is to say, a kettle has the shape of a kettle, a\nbench looks like a bench, and dress goods have the effect of dress\ngoods? Or is it the contrary, rather? Have dress goods the character of\na cloud, a bench that of a table, and a kettle that of a well? I will\nnever admit your word, I give you warning!\'--and then she began to talk\nabout the neighboring peasantry. \'They are not bad people,\' said she;\n\'not so much given to cheating as to wheedling. They are eager for\nmoney, because they are in want of everything; but they allow themselves\nnothing from the money which they make. They hoard up to buy property,\nand, when the hour has come, they are intoxicated with the delight of\nacquisition, buy too largely, borrow at any price, and are ruined. Those\nwho best understand their own interests become usurers and speculate on\nthis rage for property, sure that the lands will return to them at a\nlower price, when the purchaser shall have become bankrupt. This is why\nsome peasants climb up into the citizen class, while the greater number\nfall back lower than ever. It is the sad side of the natural law, for\nthese people are governed by an instinct almost as fatal and blind as\nthat which makes the apple-tree blossom. So the peasant interests me but\nlittle. I assist the lame and the half-witted, the widows and children,\nbut the healthy ones are not to be interfered with. They are more\nheadstrong than their mules.\'\n\n\"\'Then, Madame, what is there here to interest one?\'\n\n\"\'Nothing. We come here because the air is good, and because we can\nbenefit our health and purse a little. And then it is the custom.\nEverybody leaves Paris at the earliest possible moment. One must go away\nwhen the others do.\'\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"You see, dear Camille, by this specimen of our conversation, that the\nMarchioness looks gloomily upon the present age, and you can, too, by\nthe same means, now form some idea of this \'talking life\' of hers, which\nyou said you could not understand. Upon every subject she has an\nintelligent criticism always ready, sometimes bright and good-natured,\nsometimes sharp and bitter. She has talked too much in the course of her\nlife to be happy. Thinking of two or three or thirty people,\ncontinually, and without taking time to collect one\'s self, is, I\nbelieve, a great abuse. One ceases to question one\'s self, affirming\nalways; for otherwise there could be no discussion, and all conversation\nwould cease. Condemned to this exercise, I should give way to doubt or\nto disgust of my fellow-creatures, if I had not the long morning to\nrecover myself and find my balance again. Although Madame de Villemer,\nby her wit and good-humor, throws every possible charm about this dry\nemployment of our time, I long for the Marquis to come and take his\nshare in this dawdling oratory.\"\n\nThe Marquis did really arrive in the course of a week or ten days, but\nhe was worried and absent-minded, and Caroline noticed that he was\npeculiarly cold toward her. He plunged directly into his favorite\npursuits, and no longer allowed himself to be seen at all till the hour\nof dinner. This peculiarity was the more evident to Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix, because the Marquis seemed to be making more effort than\nhe had ever done before to stand his ground in discussions with his\nmother,--to the very great satisfaction of the latter, who feared\nnothing in the world but silence and wandering attention; so that\nCaroline, seeing herself no longer needed to spur on a lagging\nconversation, and getting the impression that she paralyzed the Marquis\nmore than she assisted him, was less assiduous in profiting by his\npresence, and took it upon herself to withdraw early in the evening.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nWhen at the end of another week the Duke also arrived, he was surprised\nby this state of affairs. Deeply touched by his brother\'s letter from\nPolignac, but believing that he detected in him rather a struggle\nagainst himself than a resolution actually formed, his Grace had\nintentionally delayed his appearance, so as to give time to the\nisolation and freedom of the country to work upon the two hearts which\nhe believed to have been moved by his words, and which he expected to\nfind in accord. He had not foreseen the absence of coquetry or\nimagination on the part of Caroline, the real dismay, serious\nresistance, internal combat, on the part of the Marquis. \"How is this\nnow?\" the Duke asked of himself, as he saw that even their friendly\ndisposition one for the other seemed to have disappeared. \"Is it a sense\nof morality that has so soon quenched the fire? Has my brother been\nmaking an abortive attempt? Is his access of sadness from fear or spite?\nIs the girl a prude? No. Ambitious? No. The Marquis will not know how to\nexplain himself. Perhaps he has kept all the powers of his mind for his\nbooks, when he should have bestowed them in the service of his growing\npassion.\"\n\nThe Duke, nevertheless, did not hasten to discover the truth. He was the\nprey of conflicting resolutions. He had succeeded in gaining a thorough\nknowledge of the state of the Marquis\'s affairs. The income of the\nlatter was barely thirty thousand francs, twelve thousand of which were\ngiven over as a pension to his spendthrift brother. The rest was applied\nalmost entirely to the support and service of the Marchioness, and the\nMarquis himself lived in his own house without making any more expense\nthere on his private account than if he had been an unobtrusive guest.\n\nThe Duke was wounded by this state of affairs, which he had brought\nabout, and of which the Marquis did not appear to think at all. His\nGrace had endured his own ruin in the most brilliant manner. He had\nshown himself a veritable grandee, and if he had lost many companions of\nhis pleasures, he had recognized many faithful friends. He had grown in\nthe opinion of the world, and he was forgiven the trouble and scandal he\nhad caused in more than one family, when he was seen to accept with\ncourage and spirit the expiation of his wild and reckless life. He had\nthus undauntedly assumed the part which was hereafter proper for him;\nbut there was a feeling of penitence which disturbed his mental balance,\nand about which he agitated himself with less clearness of sight and\nstrength of resolution than he would have done if it had been a matter\nconcerning only himself. Thoroughly sincere and well disposed in his\nlack of reason, he cast about him for the means of making his brother\nhappy. Sometimes he persuaded himself that love should be introduced\ninto Urbain\'s life of meditation and competence; at other times he\nthought it his duty to inspire the Marquis with ambition, dealing\nsharply with his repugnances and trying once more to suggest to him the\nidea of a great marriage.\n\nThis latter was also the dream of the Marchioness, one that had always\nbeen dear to her; and she now gave herself up to it more than ever,\nbelieving that her maternal enthusiasm at the generosity of the Marquis\nwould be shared by some accomplished heiress. She confided to the Duke\nthat she was in treaty with her friend, the Duchess de Dunières, about\nmarrying the Marquis to a Xaintrailles, an orphan, very rich, and\nreputed beautiful, who was weary of her studies at the convent, and who\nnevertheless was very exacting as to merit and quality. From all\nindications the thing was possible, but it was necessary that Urbain\nshould favor it, and he did not favor it, saying that he should never\nmarry, if the occasion did not come to find him, and that he was the\nlast man in the world to go and see an unknown woman with the intention\nof pleasing her.\n\n\"Try then, my son,\" said the Marchioness to the Duke, the day after his\narrival, \"to cure him of that wild timidity. As for me it is a sheer\nwaste of words.\"\n\nThe Duke undertook the task, and found his brother uncertain, careless,\nnot saying no, but refusing to take any step in the matter, and\nobserving merely that it was necessary to wait for the chance which\nmight lead him to meet the person; that, if she pleased him, he would\n_afterward_ endeavor to learn whether she had no dislike for him.\nNothing could be done just then, since they were in the country; there\nwas no hurry about it; he was not more unhappy than usual, and he had a\ngreat deal of work to do.\n\nThe Marchioness grew impatient at this compromising with time, and\ncontinued to write, taking the Duke for secretary in this affair, which\nwas not in Caroline\'s department.\n\nThe Duke seeing clearly that for six whole months this marriage would\nnot advance one step, returned to the idea of bringing about a temporary\ndiversion of his brother\'s mind by a country romance. The heroine was at\nhand, and she was charming. She was suffering perhaps a little from the\nvery apparent coldness of M. de Villemer. The Duke devoted himself to\nlearning the cause of this coldness. He failed utterly; the Marquis was\ninscrutable. His brother\'s questions seemed to astonish him.\n\nThe fact is that the idea of making love to Mlle de Saint-Geneix had\nnever entered his mind. He would have made it a very grave case of\nconscience with himself, and he did not compound with his conscience. He\nhad insensibly submitted to the strong and real attraction of Caroline,\ngiven himself up to it unreservedly; then his brother, in seeking to\nexcite his jealousy, had caused him to discover a more pronounced\ninclination in this sympathy without a name. He had suffered terribly\nfor some days. He had demanded of himself if he were free, and he\nconsidered himself placed between a mother who desired him to make an\nambitious marriage, and a brother to whom he owed the wreck of his\nfortune. He had foreseen, besides, invincible resistance in the proud\nscruples of Mlle de Saint-Geneix. He already knew enough of her\ncharacter to be certain that she would never consent to come between his\nmother and himself. Equally resolved not to commit the folly of being\nuselessly importunate, and to be guilty of the baseness of betraying the\ngood faith of a fine soul, he worked and struggled to conquer himself,\nand appeared to have succeeded miraculously. He played his part so well\nthat the Duke was deceived by it. Such courage and delicacy exceeded\nperhaps the notion which the latter had formed of a duty of this kind.\n\"I have been mistaken,\" he thought, \"my brother is absorbed in the study\nof history. It is of his book that I must speak to him.\"\n\nThereafter the Duke demanded of himself in what way he could employ his\nown imagination for the next six months of comparative inaction.\nHunting, reading novels, talking with his mother, composing a few\nballads,--these were hardly sufficient for so fantastic a spirit, and\nnaturally he began to think of Caroline as the only person who could\nthrow a little poetry and romance about his life. He had decided to pass\nthe half of the year at Séval, and that was a noble resolution for a\nman who did not like the country except with a great establishment. He\nintended, by living on the most modest footing with his brother for six\nmonths of every year, to refuse six thousand francs of his yearly\nallowance; and if the Marquis should reject the proffered sacrifice, he\npurposed to employ that sum in restoring and repairing the manor-house;\nbut he must have a little flirtation to crown all this virtue, and there\nstopped the virtue of the brave Duke.\n\n\"How shall I do,\" said he to himself, \"now that I have pledged my word\nto her, as well as to my mother, to have nothing of the kind to do with\nher! There is but one way, simpler perhaps than all the ordinary and\nworn-out ways: that is, to pay her little attentions, but with the\nappearance of entire disinterestedness; respect without gallantry, a\nfriendly regard, perfectly frank, and which will inspire her with real\nconfidence. Since, with all this I am in no way prevented from being as\nclever and gracious as I can be, and as perfectly amiable and devoted as\nI should be in showing my pretensions, it is very probable that she will\nbe sensible of them, and that of her own accord she will relieve me\nlittle by little of my oath. A woman is always astonished that at the\nend of two or three months of affectionate intimacy one does not say a\nword of love to her. And then she will find it tedious here, too, since\nmy brother\'s eyes speak to her no longer. Well, we will see. It will,\nindeed, be something quite new and spicy to conquer a heart which is\nheld in alarm, without seeming to do it, and to bring about a\ncapitulation without seeming to have been a besieger. I have seen this\nsort of artifice practised with coquettes and prudes; but I am curious\nto see how Mlle de Saint-Geneix, who is neither coquette nor prude, will\nundertake to bring about this evolution.\"\n\nThus occupied by a puerility of self-conceit, the Duke no longer gave\nway to tedium. He had never liked brutal debauch, and his dissoluteness\nhad always preserved a certain stamp of elegance. He had used and abused\nso much of life that he was sufficiently used up himself to make\nself-restraint no very difficult matter. He had said he was not sorry to\nrenew for himself his health and youth, and even at times he flattered\nhimself that he had perhaps found again the youth of the heart, of which\nhis manners and language had been able to keep up the appearance. From\nthe fact that his brain was still busy upon a perverse romance, he\nconcluded that he could still be romantic.\n\nHe manœuvred so skilfully that Mlle Saint-Geneix had the modesty to be\ncompletely deceived by his feigned honesty. Seeing that he never sought\nto be alone with her, she no longer avoided him. And while without\nlosing her from his eyes, he brought about in the most natural and\napparently the least foreseen ways occasions to meet her in her walks,\nhe took his advantage of these meetings by appearing not at all desirous\nto prolong them, and by himself withdrawing with an air of discretion\nand just the shade of regret which reconciled amiable politeness with\nprovoking indifference.\n\nHe employed all this art without Caroline\'s having the least suspicion\nof it. Her own frankness prevented her from divining a plan, of that\nnature. In the course of a week she was as much at her ease with him as\nif she had never mistrusted him, and she wrote to Madame Heudebert:--\n\n\"The Duke is greatly changed for the better since the family event which\nbrought him to himself, or indeed he never merited the accusations of\nMadame de D----. The latter perhaps is the truth, for I cannot believe\nthat a man of such refined manners and sentiments has ever desired to\nruin a woman for the sole pleasure of having a victim to boast of. She\n(Madame de D----) maintained that he has done so with all his conquests,\nout of sheer libertinism and vanity. Libertinism--I am not too sure that\nI know what that is, in the life of a man of high rank. I have lived\namong virtuous people, and all I have seen of debauchery has been among\npoor laborers, who lose their reason in wine and beat their wives in\nparoxysms of mortal frenzy. If the vice of great lords consists in\ncompromising the women of society, there must be many women of society\nwho easily allow themselves to be compromised, since so great a number\nof victims has been attributed to the Duke d\'Aléria. For my part, I do\nnot see that he concerns himself with women at all, and I never hear him\nspeak ill of any woman in particular. Quite the contrary, he praises\nvirtue, and declares that he believes in it. He seems never to have had\nanything in the way of perfidy to reproach himself with, because he\nestablishes a very marked difference between those who consent to be\nruined and those who do not consent to it. I do not know if he is\nimposing upon me, but he would appear to have loved with respect and\nsincerity. Neither his mother nor his brother seems to doubt that, and I\ncertainly like to believe that this is a sincere but inconstant nature,\nwhich it was necessary to be very credulous or very vain to have hoped\nto fix upon one object. That he has been liberal in excess, a gamester,\nforgetful of his duty to his family, intoxicated with luxury and with\ntrivial pursuits unworthy of a serious man, I do not doubt, and it is in\nthese things that I see the feebleness of his judgment and his vanity;\nbut they are the faults and misfortunes of education and of a life which\nbegan in too much privilege. His class is not usually made aware of duty\nby necessity, being taught everything that is just the opposite of\nprovidence and economy. Did not our own poor father ruin himself too,\nand who would dare say he was to blame for it? As to foppishness or\nself-conceit in the Duke, after seeking for it patiently, I have not\ndetected the least trace. His conduct here is as unaffected as that of\na country squire. He goes in the plainest and cheapest attire, and wins\nall hearts by his good-nature and simplicity. He never makes the\nslightest allusion to his past triumphs, and he never boasts of any of\nhis gifts, which are nevertheless real, for he is charmingly clever; he\nis always handsome, he sings delightfully, and even composes a\nlittle,--not very well but with a certain elegance. He talks\nmarvellously well, though not very profoundly, for he has read or\nretained only things of a light nature; but he confesses this with\ncandor, and serious topics are far from being displeasing to him, since\nhe questions his brother on every subject and listens to him\nintelligently and respectfully.\n\n\"As regards the latter, he is always the same spotless mirror, the model\nof all the virtues, and modesty itself. He is very busy upon a great\nhistorical work of which his brother says marvellous things, and that\ndoes not astonish me. Nature would have been very illogical, if she had\ndenied him the faculty of expressing the world of weighty ideas and true\nsentiments with which she has endowed his soul. He carries about with\nhim a sort of religious meditation of his work which causes him to be\nmore reserved with me, and more communicative with his mother and\nbrother than he used to be. I rejoice for them, and, as to myself, I am\nnot offended; it is very natural that he should not expect any light\nupon such grave subjects from me, and that he should be led to question\npersons who are more mature and who are better instructed in the science\nof human actions. At Paris he manifested a good deal of interest in me,\nespecially the day when his brother thought himself at liberty to tease\nme; but because he has not since showed that particular interest, I have\nnot come to the conclusion that it no longer exists, and that it may not\non occasion be again apparent. There will be, however, no such future\noccasion, since the Duke has so thoroughly improved; but I shall not be\nthe less grateful for being able to count upon so estimable a\nprotector.\"\n\nWe see that, if Caroline was really affected by the change in the manner\nof M. de Villemer, she was so without knowing it herself, and without\nwanting to yield to a vague wound. Her woman\'s self-love did not enter\ninto the question at all. She felt sure that she had done nothing to\nforfeit his esteem, and as she did not expect or desire anything more,\nshe attributed everything to a worthy preoccupation.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of all her efforts, she began to feel that the\ntime passed tediously with her. She was careful not to write this fact\nto her sister, who could have imparted no new courage, and whose letters\nwere indeed always loving, yet full of condoling and complaints about\nher absence and the manner of her self-sacrifice. Caroline humored this\ntender and timid soul, for whom she had habitually exerted a maternal\ncare, and whom she forced herself to sustain by appearing always as\nstrong and as much at ease as the force of her character enabled her\ngenerally to be; but she had her hours of profound weariness, in which\nher heart was oppressed with a dread of being alone. Although she was\nmore of a captive, more really subjected during a part of the day than\nshe had ever been in her family, she had her mornings and the last hour\nof the night in which to taste the austerity of solitude and to question\nherself of her own destiny,--a dangerous liberty which she had never\nbeen allowed when she had four children and a necessitous household upon\nher hands. At times she took refuge in certain poetical musings and\nfound in them an enchanting tenderness; at times, too, a bitterness\nwithout cause and without aim made nature hateful to her, her walks\nfatiguing, and sleep oppressive.\n\nShe struggled with herself courageously, but these attacks of melancholy\ndid not escape the eager attention of the Duke d\'Aléria. He remarked,\non certain days, a bluish shade, which made her eyes look sunken, and a\nsort of involuntary resistance in the muscles of her face when she\nsmiled. He thought that the hour was approaching, and he proceeded with\nthe plan which he had adopted. He was more kind and more attentive, and\nwhen he saw that she recognized the change in his manner, he hastened to\nremind her delicately that love had nothing to do with it. This grand\ngame, however, was all to no purpose. Caroline was so simple-natured\nthat all skill of this kind could hardly fail to be lost on her. When\nthe Duke surrounded her with delicate and charming attentions, she\nattributed them to his friendship, and when he endeavored to goad her on\nby withdrawing them she rejoiced the more that they sprang only from\nfriendship. The Duke\'s self-esteem prevented him from seeing clearly in\nthis second phase of his enterprise. Confidence had come; but, in\nreality, Caroline might open her eyes with no other pain than that of\nprofound astonishment and a pitying disdain. The Duke hoped every\nreturning day to see the growth of spite or impatience in her. He could,\nhowever, detect only a little sadness, for which he ingenuously gave\nhimself the credit, and which was mildly pleasurable, though by no means\nsatisfactory to him. \"I would have believed her more sensitive,\" thought\nhe; \"there is a trifle of torpidity in her sorrow, and more mildness\nthan warmth.\"\n\nGradually this mildness charmed him. He had never seen anything equal to\nthis supposed resignation. He saw in it a hidden modesty, a hopelessness\nof pleasing, a tender submission, which deeply touched him. \"She is good\nabove all others,\" he said to himself again,--\"good as an angel. One\ncould be very happy with that woman, she would be so grateful and so\nlittle disposed to quarrel. Truly she does not know what it is to cause\nsuffering; she keeps it all for herself.\"\n\nBy dint of waiting for his prey, the Duke found himself fascinated, and\nthe feeling grew upon him. He was forced to acknowledge that he was ill\nat ease in her presence, and that his own cruelty troubled him a great\ndeal. At the end of a month he began to lose patience, and to say to\nhimself that he must hasten the catastrophe; but that all at once\nappeared to him extremely difficult. Caroline yet had too much virtue in\nhis eyes, to permit him to forfeit his word, for in being abrupt he\nmight lose everything.\n\nEntering his mother\'s apartment one day, the Duke said, \"I have just\nbeen greatly amusing myself riding one of your farm colts. He resembles\na wild boar and a trotting errand-boy at the same time. He has fire and\nspeed, and is very gentle besides. Mlle de Saint-Geneix might ride him\nif she happens to be fond of the exercise.\"\n\n\"I am very fond of it,\" she replied. \"My father required it of me, and I\nwas not grieved to satisfy him in that regard.\"\n\n\"Then I will wager you are an excellent rider?\"\n\n\"No, I can sit upright and have a nimble hand, like all women.\"\n\n\"Like all women who ride well, for generally women are nervous and would\nlike to lead men and horses after the same fashion; but that is not your\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"As far as men are concerned, I know nothing at all about it. I have\nnever attempted to lead any one.\"\n\n\"O, you will attempt that, too, some day?\"\n\n\"It is not probable.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Marchioness, \"it is not probable. She does not wish to\nmarry, and in her position she is greatly in the right.\"\n\n\"O, certainly,\" rejoined the Duke. \"Marriage without fortune must be a\nhell!\"\n\nHe looked at Caroline to see if she were moved by such a declaration.\nShe was quite passive; she had renounced marriage sincerely and\nirrevocably.\n\nThe Duke, wishing to judge whether she was armed against the idea of an\nirreparable fault, added, in order to compromise nothing too gravely,\n\"Yes, it must be a hell except in the case of a great passion which\ngives the heroism to undergo everything.\"\n\nCaroline was still just as calm and apparently a stranger to the\nquestion.\n\n\"Ah! my son, what nonsense are you preaching now? There are days when\nyou talk like a child.\"\n\n\"But you know well enough that I am very much of a child,\" said the\nDuke; \"and I hope to be so for a long time to come.\"\n\n\"It is being altogether too much so to rest the chances of happiness in\nmisery,\" said the Marchioness, who courted discussion. \"There is no such\nthing; misery kills all, even love.\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion, Mlle de Saint-Geneix?\" rejoined the Duke.\n\n\"O, I have no opinion on the subject,\" she replied. \"I know nothing of\nlife beyond a certain limit, but I should be led in this instance to\nbelieve with your mother rather than with you. I have known misery, and\nif I have suffered it was in seeing its weight upon those whom I loved.\nThere is no need, therefore, of extending and complicating one\'s life\nwhen it is already so perplexing. That would be to go in search of\ndespair.\"\n\n\"Bless me! everything is relative,\" exclaimed the Duke. \"That which is\nthe misery of some is the opulence of others. Would you not be very rich\nwith an income of twelve thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Caroline, without remembering and perhaps even\nwithout knowing that to be the exact amount of her questioner\'s yearly\nallowance.\n\n\"Well, then,\" continued the Duke, who endeavored to inspire a hope with\none word that he might crush it with the next,--still intent upon his\nplan of agitating this placid or timid heart,--\"if any one should offer\nyou such a modest competence as that, together with a sincere love?\"\n\n\"I could not accept,\" Caroline rejoined. \"I have four children to\nsupport and rear; no husband would accept such a past as that.\"\n\n\"She is charming,\" cried the Marchioness; \"she speaks of her past like\na widow.\"\n\n\"Ah! I did not speak of the widow, my poor sister. With myself and an\nold woman-servant, who is attached to us, and who shall share the last\nmorsel of bread in the house, we are seven, neither more nor less. Now\ndo you know the young man to marry with his twelve thousand francs a\nyear? I think decidedly he would make a very bad bargain.\"\n\nCaroline always spoke of her situation with an unaffected cheerfulness,\nwhich showed the sincerity of her nature.\n\n\"Well, in point of fact, you are right,\" said the Duke. \"You will get\nthrough life better all alone with your fine, brave spirit. I believe,\nindeed, that you and I are the only persons in the world who are really\nphilosophers. I regard poverty as nothing when one is responsible only\nto his own free will, and I must say that I was never before so happy as\nI am now.\"\n\n\"So much the better, my son,\" said the Marchioness, with an almost\nimperceptible shade of reproach, which the Duke, however, perceived in\nan instant, for he hastened to add,--\n\n\"I shall be completely happy the day my brother makes the marriage in\nquestion, and he will make it, will he not, dear mother?\"\n\nCaroline was on the point of going to examine the clock.\n\n\"No, no, it is not slow; it is just right,\" said the Marchioness. \"We\nhave no secrets from you hereafter, dear little one, and you must know\nthat I have to-day received good news relative to a great project which\nI have for my son. If I have not made use of your pretty hand in\nnegotiating this matter, it is for reasons altogether different from\nthat of distrust. Here, read us this letter, of which my elder son as\nyet knows nothing.\"\n\nCaroline would have gladly refrained from looking thus in advance into\nthe secrets of the family, and especially into those of the Marquis. She\nhesitated; \"M. de Villemer is not here,\" she said; \"I do not know that\nhe, for his part, will approve of the entire confidence with which you\nhonor me--\"\n\n\"Yes, he will, certainly,\" answered the Marchioness. \"If I had a doubt\nof it, I would not beg you to read it. Come, now begin, my dear.\"\n\nThere was nothing further to be said to the Marchioness. Caroline read\nas follows:--\n\n\n\"Yes, dear friend, it must and will succeed. True, the fortune of Mlle\nde X---- is upwards of four millions at least, but she knows it, and is\nno prouder on that account. On the contrary, after a new attempt on my\npart, she said to me no later than this morning, \'You are right, dear\ngodmother; I have the power and the privilege to enrich a man of true\nmerit. All you tell me of your friend\'s son gives me an exalted idea of\nhim. Let me complete the time of my mourning at the convent, and I will\nconsent to see him at your house the coming autumn.\'\n\n\"It is well understood that in all this affair I have named no one, but\nyour history and that of your two sons are so well known, that my dear\nDiana has divined. I did not think I ought to let pass the chance to\nmake the excellent conduct of the Marquis do valuable service in the\nattainment of our object. The Duke, his brother, has himself proclaimed\nit everywhere, with a feeling which does him honor. Do not, therefore,\nprolong your retreat at Séval too far into the bad season. Diana must\nnot see too much society before the interview. Society takes away, even\nfrom the most candid natures, that first freshness of faith and\ngenerosity, which I admire, and which I do my best to preserve in my\nnoble godchild. You will continue my work, I know, when she is your\ndaughter, my worthy friend. It is my most earnest wish to see your dear\nson recover the place in the world which is his due. To have lost it\nwithout a frown is fine in him, and the only finer thing which a person\nof lineage can do is to restore it to him. It is the duty of the\ndaughters of gentle blood to give these grand examples of pride to the\nupstarts of the day, and as I am one of these daughters, I shall be\nsatisfied with nothing short of success in this matter, putting all my\nheart in it, all my religion, all my devotion for you.\n\n\"DUCHESS DE DUNIÈRES,\nnée DE FONTARQUES.\"\n\n\nThe Duke could have scrutinized Caroline after the reading of this\nletter, in which her voice never once grew weak: he would not have\ndetected in her the least effort, the least personal feeling which was\nnot in harmony with the satisfaction felt by himself; but he never\nthought of observing her! In presence of a family affair so important,\npoor Caroline held a place quite secondary and accidental in his mind,\nand he would have reproached himself for thinking of her at all, when he\nsaw in the future of his brother the providential reparation of the evil\nwhich he had caused. \"Yes,\" he cried, joyfully kissing the hands of his\nmother,--\"yes, you will be happy again, and I shall cease to blush. My\nbrother shall be the man, the head of the family. The whole world shall\nknow his rare worth, for without fortune, in the eyes of the majority,\ntalent and virtue are not sufficient. He will then be master of\neverything, this dear brother, glory, honor, credit, power, and all in\nspite of those little fine gentlemen of the citizen court, and without\nbending at all before the pretended necessities of politics. Mother,\nhave you shown this letter to Urbain?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son, to be sure.\"\n\n\"And he is satisfied? Things are already so far under way, the lady\nprepossessed in his favor, accepting in advance, and asking only to see\nhim--\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, he has promised to allow himself to be introduced.\"\n\n\"Victory!\" cried the Duke. \"Then let us be gay, let us do something\nfoolish! I want to jump up to the ceiling, I want to embrace some one,\nit makes no matter whom! Dear mamma, will you let me go and embrace my\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Yes, but do not congratulate him too much; he is startled at anything\nnew, you understand?\"\n\n\"O, never fear; I know him.\"\n\nAnd the Duke, still very nimble in spite of his tendency to stoutness\nand the more or less damaged state of his joints, went out gambolling\nlike a school-boy.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nHe found the Marquis absorbed in his work. \"Do I disturb you? So much\nthe worse!\" cried the Duke. \"I must embrace you. My mother has just read\nme the letter from the Duchess de Dunières.\"\n\n\"But, my friend, the marriage is not yet arranged,\" replied the Marquis,\nwhile he submitted to the fraternal hugging.\n\n\"It is arranged if you wish it, and you cannot be opposed to it.\"\n\n\"My friend, I might perhaps wish it ever so much. I would still have to\nbe simply charming to sustain the brilliant reputation which that old\nDuchess has made for me, a great deal too much at your expense, I am\ninclined to think.\"\n\n\"The Duchess has done just right, except only that she has not said\nenough. I should like to go to her and let her know everything. He\nbelieves that he is not charming! See how little he knows himself!\"\n\n\"I know myself too well,\" rejoined M. de Villemer; \"I am not mistaken.\"\n\n\"The deuce take! Do you consider yourself a bear? You were attractive\nenough to Madame de G----, the most reserved person in the world.\"\n\n\"Ah! I pray you do not speak of her; you remind me of all I suffered\nbefore I could inspire her with confidence in me,--all I afterwards\nsuffered lest that confidence should from moment to moment be withdrawn.\nLook here!\" added the Marquis, slightly forgetting himself; \"people who\nare subject to strong passion have no reason. You do not know that, for\nyou attract at first sight, and besides you do not seek for an exclusive\nlove which shall endure for a lifetime. I know but one word to say to a\nwoman,--_I love_, and if she does not understand that my whole soul is\nin that word, I could never add another.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you will love Diana de Xaintrailles, and she will\nunderstand that supreme word of yours.\"\n\n\"But suppose I should not love her?\"\n\n\"O my dear fellow, she is charming. I saw her when she was quite little;\nshe was a very cherub.\"\n\n\"Every one, I know, calls her charming; but what if she does not please\nme? Do not tell me that it is not necessary to adore one\'s wife,--that\nit suffices to esteem her and know her to be agreeable. I do not want to\nargue on that subject; it would be throwing away time. Let us confine\nourselves to the question of my pleasing her. If I do not love, I do not\nknow how to make myself loved, and therefore I shall not marry.\"\n\n\"One would indeed think you expect and depend upon that!\" exclaimed the\nDuke with real sorrow. \"Ah! our poor mother, who is so happy in her\nhope! And I, who believed myself absolved by destiny! Urbain, must it be\nthen that we are under a curse, all three of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Marquis, deeply moved; \"let us not despair. I am\nworking to modify my timid, unsociable character. Upon honor, I am\nworking with all my power for that end. I want to put an end to this\nagitated, sterile existence. Give me the summer to triumph over my\nmemories, my doubts, my apprehensions; true, I want to make you happy,\nand God perhaps will come to my aid.\"\n\n\"Thank you, brother; you are the best of beings!\" responded the Duke,\nembracing him again. And as the Marquis was much agitated, he led him\nforth to walk, in order to divert his mind from his work and to fortify\nhim in his good intentions.\n\nThe Duke did then what Urbain had done to conquer him on the day of\ntheir first real intimacy. He represented himself weak and suffering as\na means of restoring his brother\'s strength and courage. He gave vivid\nexpression to his remorse and spoke feelingly of the need he had of\nmoral support. \"Two unhappy people can do nothing for each other,\" he\nsaid; \"your melancholy has its fatal rebound on me, and overcomes me.\nThe day when I see you happy, real energy and the joy of living will\nreturn to me.\"\n\nUrbain, touched by these words, renewed his promise, and, as it cost him\ndearly, he forced it from his mind by leading his brother\'s talk to\nlively subjects; this did not take long, for the Duke required but\nlittle encouragement to return to the theme which had lately been\nabsorbing so much of his time and thought.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, seeing his brother smile, \"you will bring me happiness\nin everything. I am reminded now that for some days I have had a\nvexation intense enough in all conscience; it has made me sullen,\nawkward; my mind has been clouded; I could not see my way clearly. I\nhave been frightfully stupid. I am sure that I shall now recover my\nfaculties.\"\n\n\"Again some story of a woman?\" asked the Marquis, mastering a vague and\nsudden uneasiness.\n\n\"And what would you want it to be? That little De Saint-Geneix occupies\nmy mind more perhaps than she ought.\"\n\n\"It is exactly what she ought not to do,\" quickly replied the Marquis.\n\"Have you not given your oath to our mother? She told me you had. Have\nyou deceived mother?\"\n\n\"No, not at all; but I should like very much to be compelled to deceive\nher.\"\n\n\"Compelled? I have no idea what you mean.\"\n\n\"Dear me! Well, this is just what I mean.\" And the Duke gave his brother\na detailed account of how he had at first told a falsehood when he\nannounced himself in love with Caroline, from the commendable motive of\ngetting Urbain himself in love with her; how, seeing that he had not\nsucceeded, he had conceived the plan of making her love him, without\nloving her; and how at last he had fallen sincerely in love with her\nhimself, without a surety that his feeling was returned. Nevertheless,\nhe added that he counted upon victory if he could only have the courage\nnot to declare himself; and he said all this in terms so delicate or so\nambiguous that the Marquis could not give him a moral lecture about it\nwithout making himself ridiculous. Then, when the latter, recovering\nfrom his stupefaction, attempted to speak of the repose of his mother\nand the dignity of their domestic life, not daring in his distress to\nsay anything whatever of the respect due to Caroline, the Duke, becoming\nimpressed with a sudden fear that his brother might think it his duty,\nto give her warning, swore that he would do nothing to tempt her, but\nthat if of her own accord she threw herself bravely into his arms at any\ngiven moment, without conditions and without calculation, he was ready\nto marry her. Was he sincere then? Yes, probably, as he had always been,\nwhen eagerness had given the appearance of possibility to what passion\nhad afterward caused him to evade.\n\nAs his brother spoke from a kind of conviction, the Marquis dared not\nexpress himself against this unlooked-for repetition of offence in the\nstrange project. He knew that their mother did not expect to make an\nadvantageous marriage for the one of her sons who no longer offered a\nguaranty of character, and the Duke proved to him by arguments cogent\nenough that he alone was the master of his future, to whom ambition was\nno longer permitted. \"You see,\" he said, in conclusion, \"that all this\nis very serious. I attempted once more to lay a snare, I will confess to\nyou, but I did not expect to profit by it; it was merely a game without\nresults. I was taken in my own net, and I suffer for it a great deal. I\ndo not ask you to aid me, but I prohibit you in the name of our\nfriendship from influencing any one about us; for, if you frighten Mlle\nde Saint-Geneix, you will exasperate me perhaps, and I no longer answer\nfor anything; or, if you succeed in making me renounce her, it is she\nwho, exasperated, will perhaps commit some folly in the estimation of my\nmother. Since things are so situated that they can be cleared up only by\nsome unforeseen circumstance, do not interfere in any way, and be\ncertain that I shall conduct myself, come what may, in a manner to\nreassure your delicacy and to conflict neither with our mother\'s peace\nnor with the proprieties of the hospitality which you extend to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nDuring this conversation, so painful to the Marquis, Caroline was having\na talk with the Marchioness, which, without disturbing her so much, was\nby no means cheering to her. The Marchioness, full of her project,\nshowed her young favorite a depth of family ambition, which the latter\nhad never suspected. What she had loved and admired in the Marchioness\nwas the chivalrous disinterestedness and resignation to the loss of\nwealth and to the actual state of things which had struck her so\nforcibly; but now she was compelled to modify her impressions, and to\nrecognize the fact that this unselfish philosophy was only a fine\ncostume gracefully worn. The Marchioness, however, was not a hypocrite;\na person as communicative as she was had little or no premeditation,\ngood or bad; she yielded to the sway of the moment, and did not think\nherself illogical in saying that she would rather die of famine than see\none of her sons do a mean thing to enrich himself, but that,\nnevertheless, dying of famine was very hard, that her own present\ncondition was a life of privation, while that of the Marquis was a\npurgatory; and finally, that one cannot be happy unless, along with\nhonor and the pride of a blameless conscience, one has an income of at\nleast two hundred thousand francs.\n\nCaroline ventured to make a few general objections, which the\nMarchioness quickly repulsed. \"Should not,\" she asked, \"the sons of\ngreat families lead those of all other classes of society? This is a\nreligion which you ought to have,--you, who are of good family. You\nought to understand that gentlefolks have demands upon them--demands\nlegitimate or, perhaps, obligatory--for a very large liberality, and\nthat the higher the position these persons hold, the more it is required\nof them to possess a fortune on a level with their natural elevation. I\nsuffer bitterly, I assure you, when I see the Marquis settling accounts\nhimself with his farmers, busying himself about certain inevitable\nwastings, and even, if necessary, descending to the details of my\nkitchen. To one knowing our distress, it seems admirable in him to be\ntormenting himself thus that I may want for nothing; but with those who\nhave no correct idea of this, we must certainly pass for misers, and so\nfall to the level of the lower classes!\"\n\n\"Since you suffer so much,\" said Caroline, \"from what I have considered\nan easy life, a very honorable one, and even a very noble one, God grant\nthat this marriage may succeed, for you would have to renew your store\nof courage in case of any obstacle. Nevertheless, if I may be permitted\nto have an opinion--\"\n\n\"One should always have opinions. Speak, my dear child.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I should say that it would be safest and wisest to accept\nthe present state of affairs as quite endurable, without, on that\naccount, giving up the marriage in question.\"\n\n\"And what signify disappointments, my poor little one? You fear that I\nshall have them? They do not kill, and hopes give us life. But why do\nyou doubt the fulfilment of mine?\"\n\n\"O, I do not doubt it,\" replied Caroline; \"why should I have any doubts,\nif Mlle de Xaintrailles is as perfect as she is said to be?\"\n\n\"She is perfect, as you can very well see, since she decides in favor of\npersonal merit, contenting herself with her own wealth.\"\n\n\"That does not seem to me very difficult,\" thought Caroline; but she was\nnot inclined to make any audible rejoinder, and the Marchioness\nproceeded: \"Besides, she is a Xaintrailles! Only think, my dear, of the\nprestige of such a name! Do you not see that a person of that blood, if\nshe is fine at all, cannot be so by halves? Come, you are not\nsufficiently convinced of the excellence that comes to us by descent. I\nbelieve I have noticed this in you before. You have, perhaps,\nphilosophized a little too much about it. Distrust all these new ideas\nand the pretensions of these self-made gentlemen! They may say and do\nwhat they will, but a man of low origin will never be truly noble at\nheart; a sordid weight of prudence and parsimony will always cling to\nhim, like a birth-mark, and stifle his finer impulses. You will never\nsee him sacrifice his fortune and his life for an idea, for his\nreligion, for his prince, or for his honorable name. He may do brilliant\ndeeds from a love of glory; but there will always be a personal interest\nin it some way; so do not be at all deceived by it.\"\n\nCaroline felt wounded at the infatuation which the Marchioness professed\nto feel for the patrician orders. She found means to change the subject\nof the conversation; but, while they were at dinner, she was absorbed in\nthe idea that her old friend, her tender adopted mother, assigned her\nunceremoniously to a place among these second-class families. The\nMarchioness had thought that she might speak thus before a gentleman\'s\ndaughter, having the feelings proper to her class and therefore imbued\nwith good principles; but Caroline said to herself, and very reasonably,\ntoo, that her claims to nobility were slight, questionable, perhaps. Her\nancestors, who were provincial magistrates, had been ennobled in the\nreign of Louis XIV; her father, without great presumption, had therefore\nassumed the title of knight. She saw plainly, then, that the disdain of\nthe Marchioness for the lower classes was a question of degree, and that\na girl who was poor and of the lesser nobility was, in her eyes, twice\nher inferior in all respects.\n\nThis discovery did not awaken a foolish sensitiveness in Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix, but her natural sense of justice revolted against a\nprejudice so solemnly imposed as a duty upon her belief. \"So,\" said she\nto herself, \"my life of misery, of self-sacrifice, of courage, and of\ncheerfulness withal, even my voluntary renunciation of all the joys of\nlife, are nothing to the heroism of a Xaintrailles, who consents to be\ncontented with two hundred thousand francs a year, that she may marry an\naccomplished man! It is because she is a Xaintrailles that her choice is\nsublime, and because I am only a Saint-Geneix, my sacrifice is a thing\nvulgar and obligatory!\"\n\nCaroline repelled these thoughts of wounded self-respect, but they\ntraced a slight furrow on her expressive face, in passing. A beauty\nwhich is true and fresh can hide nothing. The Duke observed this trace\nof secret melancholy and ingenuously attributed it to himself. His\ndelusion increased when he saw that in spite of her efforts to maintain\nher usual cheerfulness, Mlle de Saint-Geneix grew more and more\nthoughtful. The real cause was this: Caroline had, exactly as was her\nwont, addressed to the Marquis certain questions about the household\naccounts, and he, usually so polite, had compelled her to repeat them.\nShe thought that he, too, must be absent-minded or ill at ease; but two\nor three times she met a glance from him, which was cold, haughty,\nalmost contemptuous. Chilled with surprise and terror, she suddenly\nbecame dejected and was obliged to attribute her state of mind to a\nheadache.\n\nThe Duke had a vague suspicion of the truth so far as his brother was\nconcerned; but this suspicion was dissipated when he saw the latter\nsuddenly recover his gayety. He did not imagine the alternations of\ndepression and reaction through which this troubled soul was passing,\nand, thinking he might now with impunity bestow attention upon Caroline,\n\"You are not well,\" said he, \"I see that you are really suffering!\nMother, do have a care; Mlle de Saint-Geneix has been looking pale for\nsome time past.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked the Marchioness, looking at Caroline with some\ninterest. \"Are you ill, my darling? Do not conceal it from me.\"\n\n\"I am remarkably well,\" said Caroline. \"It is true that I feel to-day a\nsomewhat unusual desire for fresh air and sunshine; but it is nothing at\nall.\"\n\n\"But it is something, though,\" returned the Marchioness, regarding her\nattentively, \"and the Duke is right. You are very much changed. You must\ngo take the fresh air at once, or retire to your room, perhaps. It is\ntoo warm here. I expect a whole company of neighbors this evening. I\nhave no need of you; I give you a holiday.\"\n\n\"Do you know what will restore you!\" asked the Duke of poor Caroline,\nnow thoroughly vexed by the attention of which she was the object: \"you\nought to ride horseback. The little rustic quadruped that I told you\nabout is gentle and strong. Would you like to try him!\"\n\n\"All alone!\" demanded the Marchioness; \"and a horse not properly\ntrained!\"\n\n\"I am sure that Mlle Caroline would be amused,\" said the Duke. \"She is\nbrave, she is afraid of nothing, as I very well know. Besides, I will\nhave an eye to her myself; I will answer for her.\"\n\nHe insisted so much, that the Marchioness asked Caroline if this\nhorseback ride would be really to her taste.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, impelled by the necessity of escape from the\noppression which was wellnigh crushing her. \"I am just childish enough\nto be amused in that way; but some other day will do better. I have no\nwish to make a display of my riding before the people whom you expect,\nespecially as my first appearance is likely to be very awkward.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you shall go into the park,\" said the Marchioness; \"it is\ndeeply shaded, so that no one can witness your first attempt; but I want\nsomebody to follow you on horseback,--old André, for instance. He is a\ngood squire, and has a staid nag, for which you can exchange yours, if\nhe is too unruly.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that\'s it!\" exclaimed the Duke. \"André on old Blanche, that\nis perfect. I will superintend the start myself, and all will go well.\"\n\n\"But a side-saddle!\" interposed the Marquis, apparently indifferent to\nthis equestrian project.\n\n\"There is one; I saw it in the saddle-room,\" replied the Duke, quickly.\n\"I will run and arrange all that.\"\n\n\"And a riding-habit!\" said the Marchioness.\n\n\"The first long skirt will be sufficient,\" said Caroline, suddenly bent\nupon braving the hostile air of the Marquis and upon escaping from his\npresence. The Marchioness bade her make her preparations, and, leaning\nupon the arm of her second son, she went to meet her visitors as they\narrived.\n\nWhen Mlle de Saint-Geneix came down the winding staircase from her room\nin the little tower, she found the horse already saddled, and held by\nthe Duke in person before the small arched door which looked out on the\nlawn. André was there also, mounted upon an old cabbage-carting nag of\nproverbial leanness and very miserably accoutred, for everything\nbelonging to the stable was in complete disorder. Confined strictly to\nwhat was necessary, even necessary things had not as yet been put into\norder. The Marquis, more embarrassed in his circumstances than he was\nwilling to confess, intrenched himself behind the habit of blaming his\nown negligence, while the Duke, suspecting the truth, had declared that,\nfor his own part, he preferred hunting on foot, as a check to his\ntendency to corpulence.\n\nTo equip Jacquet (that was the name of the farm-colt, raised twelve\nhours ago to the dignity of saddle horse) had been no small undertaking,\nand André, bewildered by this sudden fancy, would not have been prompt\nin finding the side-saddle and putting it in a condition for use. The\nDuke had done everything himself, in a quarter of an hour, with the\nswiftness and skill of a practised hand. He was in a lively\nperspiration, and Caroline was confused enough to see him holding the\nstirrup for her, arranging the curb, and tightening the girths as if he\nhad been a jockey by profession, laughing at the incongruity of things,\nand playing his part gayly, while he paid her all the hundred little\nattentions which a fraternal prudence could dictate.\n\nWhen Mlle de Saint-Geneix had started off on a trot, after having\nthanked him cordially and begged him not to be anxious about her, the\nDuke dismissed André, nimbly mounted the beast of the cabbage cart,\nplunged the spurs into his sides, and resolutely followed Caroline into\nthe shadows of the park.\n\n\"What! is that you?\" said she to him, stopping after the first gallop.\n\"You, your Grace the Duke, mounted in that fashion, and taking the\ntrouble to escort me! No, that cannot be. I will not have it; let us go\nback again.\"\n\n\"Why, how so?\" he asked. \"Are you afraid to be alone with me now? Have\nwe not met each other here in these avenues at all hours, and have I\never annoyed you with my eloquence?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Caroline, with entire confidence. \"I have no\nsuch whims as that, you know very well; but that horse of yours,--it is\na torture to you.\"\n\n\"Are you comfortable on yours?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"In that case we could not be better suited. As for myself, I take great\ndelight in riding this white nag. See! Don\'t I look as well as I should\nupon a blooded steed? Down with all prejudice; let us amuse ourselves\nwith a gallop!\"\n\n\"But what if this creature\'s legs should give out?\"\n\n\"Bah! it will do well enough. And if it does break my neck, why, I shall\nhave the extreme happiness of knowing that it happens in your service.\"\n\nThe Duke lanced this bit of flattery with a tone of gayety which could\nnot alarm Caroline. They set out on a gallop and made the circuit of the\npark quite bravely. Jacquet behaved excellently, showing no vicious\ninclinations of any kind; besides, Mlle de Saint-Geneix was a good\nrider, and the Duke noticed that she was as graceful as she was skilful\nand self-possessed. She had improvised a long skirt by dexterously\nletting down a hem; she had thrown over her shoulders a jacket of white\ndimity, and her little straw gardening-hat on her blond curls,\ndishevelled by the race, was wonderfully becoming. Animated by the\npleasure of the ride, she looked so remarkably beautiful that the Duke,\nfollowing with his eye the elegant moulding of her form, and the\nbrilliant smile which played about her candid mouth, felt himself\ndazzled by them. \"The devil take the oath which I let them get from me\nso unsuspectingly!\" said he to himself. \"Who would have thought I should\nhave so much trouble in keeping it?\" But it was necessary that Caroline\nshould be the first to betray herself, and the Duke led her slowly\naround the park again to let the horses breathe, but all to no purpose;\nshe chatted with a witty freedom and general good-humor, which did not\nadmit the idea of any painful agitation.\n\n\"O, so, that is it?\" thought he, as they recommenced their gallop. \"You\nimagine that I am going to dislocate my joints on this Apocalyptic beast\nto converse just as we should under the maternal eye? Some one else may\ntry it for all me! I am going to sadden your tranquil gratitude by a\nretreat which will give you material for reflection.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said he to Caroline,--he sometimes allowed himself to\nuse this expression in a tone of easy good-nature,--\"you are very sure\nof Jacquet now, are you not?\"\n\n\"Perfectly sure.\"\n\n\"He is not at all inclined to shy, and is not hard-bitted?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Very well, if you are willing, I will leave you to yourself, and send\nAndré in my place.\"\n\n\"Do so, do so by all means!\" replied Caroline; quickly; \"or don\'t send\nany one at all. I will go around the park once more, and then I will\ntake the animal back to André. Really, I shall enjoy cantering alone,\nand it pains me to see you so frightfully jolted.\"\n\n\"O, it is not that,\" responded the Duke, resolved upon a bold stroke.\n\"I\'m not yet so old as to be afraid of a hard horse; but I remember that\nMadame d\'Arglade is coming to-night.\"\n\n\"Not to-night; to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That is not certain,\" said the Duke, watching for the effect his words\nmight produce.\n\n\"O, then, perhaps, you are better informed than I am.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, my dear friend! Madame d\'Arglade--In fact, it is sufficient--\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed?\" replied Caroline, laughing. \"I did not know. Go quickly,\nthen; I shall escape, and--a thousand thanks again for your kindness.\"\n\nShe was about to start her horse, but the Duke detained her. \"What I am\ndoing now is not polite, to say the least of it.\"\n\n\"It is better than polite; it is very good of you.\"\n\n\"O, then you have had enough of my company?\"\n\n\"That is not what I mean. I say that your impoliteness is a proof of\nyour confidence in me, and that I take it as such.\"\n\n\"Do you think she is pretty,--Madame d\'Arglade, I mean?\"\n\n\"Very pretty.\"\n\n\"How old is she, precisely?\"\n\n\"Very nearly my own age. We were together at the convent.\"\n\n\"I know it. Were you great friends?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly; but she has shown much interest in me since my\nmisfortunes.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was she who was the means of bringing you here. Why did you\ndetest each other at the convent?\"\n\n\"We did not detest each other; we were not very intimate,--that was\nall.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now she is kind to me, and consequently I like her.\"\n\n\"Then you like people who are kind to you?\"\n\n\"Is not that natural?\"\n\n\"Then you like me a little, for it seems to me that I am not unkind to\nyou myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly, you are excellent, and I like you very much.\"\n\n\"Just hear how she says that! I love my nurse dearly, but I love to ride\non my rocking-horse better still! Come, tell me, you don\'t mean to\nprejudice your little friend D\'Arglade against me, do you?\"\n\n\"Prejudice her against you! There are some words in your vocabulary\nwhich do not get into mine.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true, I beg pardon. It is because--you see, she is\nsuspicious--she may question you. You will not fail to tell her that I\nhave never made love to you?\"\n\n\"O, as to that, count upon her knowing the truth,\" replied Caroline,\nstarting. And the Duke heard her laugh as she rode off at full speed.\n\n\"There!\" said he to himself, \"I have lied, and it is trouble wasted. I\nhave made a precious blunder, have n\'t I? She does n\'t love any one,--or\nelse she has a little lover somewhere, in reserve against the day when a\nthousand crowns shall be forthcoming to set up housekeeping with. Poor\ngirl! If I had them, I would give them to her! It\'s all the same; I have\nbeen ridiculous. Perhaps she saw it too. Perhaps she will laugh at me\nwith her \'dear friend,\' when she writes to him secretly, for she does\nwrite a great deal. If I did think so!--But I have given my word of\nhonor.\"\n\nThe Duke withdrew, trying to laugh at himself, but annoyed at losing his\ngame, and almost angry.\n\nJust as he was leaving the wood, he saw a man gliding into it\ncautiously. The evening had come; he could distinguish nothing about\nthis man except his furtive movements, in trying to penetrate the\nthicket. \"Stop, stop,\" thought he, \"this is perhaps the lover in\nquestion, coming to make a mysterious visit. By Jove! I will be\nsatisfied on that point! I will know who it is!\" He dismounted, gave a\nvigorous blow with his riding-whip to Blanche, who needed neither urging\nnor guiding to take the road to her stable, and stole away under the\ntrees in the direction which Caroline had taken. It would have been\nalmost impossible to find the man in the coppice, and besides there was\nthe risk of giving him the alarm. To walk noiselessly in the dark\nshadows, along the walk, and to see how these two persons would meet and\nconduct themselves was, he considered, by far the surest course.\n\nCaroline had already ceased thinking at all about the Duke. After having\nbecomingly withdrawn to avoid disclosures hardly proper for her to hear,\nand which had astonished her coming from the lips of a man so well bred,\nshe had brought the little horse down to a slow pace, lest she might\ncome in contact with the boughs in the darkness. And, indeed, she felt\ninclined rather to think her own thoughts just then than to ride at\ngreater speed. An absorbing anxiety weighed upon her mind. The attitude\nof the Marquis toward her was inexplicable and almost offensive. She\nsearched for the cause of this in the most secret recesses of her\nconscience, and finding nothing there amiss, she reproached herself for\nthinking so much about it. He was perhaps subject to certain whims, like\nmany people absorbed in great tasks; and after all, even if she had\nbecome displeasing to him, was he not about to be married, and would not\nthe joy of the Marchioness be so complete that a poor young lady\ncompanion could leave her without ingratitude?\n\nWhile she was thus thinking of her future, promising herself that she\nwould speak about it to Madame d\'Arglade, who would perhaps aid her in\nfinding another situation, her horse was stopped suddenly, and she saw\nbefore her a man whose movements frightened her.\n\n\"Is it you, André?\" asked she, as she perceived that her horse seemed\nto be obeying a well-known hand. And as there was no answer and she\ncould distinguish nothing of the clothes worn by the person confronting\nher, she added, quickly and anxiously, \"Is it you, your Grace the Duke?\nWhy do you stop me?\"\n\nShe received no reply; the man had disappeared; the horse was free. She\nwas overcome by a vague fear, and, not daring to turn round, she urged\nJacquet forward, and returned to the house on a gallop without seeing\nany one.\n\nThe Duke was ten paces off when this singular encounter took place. He\nsaw nothing, but heard the frightened voice of Mlle de Saint-Geneix at\nthe moment of the horse\'s sudden stop. He sprang forward, and finding\nhimself face to face with an unknown person, he seized him by the\ncollar, demanding, \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe unknown person struggled vigorously to escape from this\ninvestigation; but the Duke, who was a very powerful man, dragged his\nadversary out of the wood into the path. There, what was his ineffable\nsurprise to recognize his brother?\n\n\"Heavens! Urbain,\" cried he, \"did I not strike you? It seems to me that\nI did. But why didn\'t you answer me?\"\n\n\"I don\'t know,\" replied M. de Villemer, much agitated. \"I did not\nrecognize your voice! Did you speak to me? Whom did you take me for,\nthen?\"\n\n\"For a robber, in sober earnest! Did you not frighten Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix just now?\"\n\n\"I perhaps frightened her horse, unintentionally. Where is she?\"\n\n\"Why, she was afraid and took to flight. Did you not hear her riding off\ntoward the house?\"\n\n\"And why should she have been afraid of me?\" rejoined the Marquis, with\nsingular bitterness. \"I did not wish to offend her.\" And then, weary of\ndeception, he added, \"I merely wanted to speak to her!\"\n\n\"About whom? About me?\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps. I wanted to know whether she loved you.\"\n\n\"And why did n\'t you speak to her?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I could not say a word to her.\"\n\n\"Are you in pain?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am ill, very ill, to-day.\"\n\n\"Let us go in, brother,\" said the Duke. \"I see that you are in a fever,\nand the dew is falling.\"\n\n\"No matter!\" said the Marquis, seating himself on a block at the edge of\nthe walk. \"I wish I was dead!\"\n\n\"Urbain!\" cried the Duke, a sudden light striking him at last; \"it is\nyou who are in love with Mlle de Saint-Geneix!\"\n\n\"I in love with her? Is she not,--is she not yours?\"\n\n\"Never, since you love her! On my part it was only a caprice, an idle,\nselfish vanity; but, as truly as I am my father\'s son, she has not the\nleast inclination toward me; she has just simply understood nothing of\nmy artifices; she is as pure, as free, and as proud as on the day she\ncame among us.\"\n\n\"Why did you leave her alone in this wood after you had brought her out\ninto it?\"\n\n\"Ah! you suspect me after the solemn assertion that I have just made!\nCan it be that love is making you insane?\"\n\n\"You have played with your promise about this young lady. For you, in\nquestions of gallantry, oaths count nothing; I know that. If it were\notherwise, would you and your fortunate compeers be able to persuade so\nmany women? Do you not know how to slip away from all engagements? Was\nit honorable, this absurd manœuvring,--which may have been very\nskilfully done for aught I know about such games,--to draw her into your\narms through fascination, through spite, through all the weak or bad\nimpulses in woman\'s nature? Is there anything that you do respect! Is\nnot virtue, in your eyes, an infirmity of which a poor innocent girl,\nhelpless and inexperienced, must be cured? Is not the abyss into which\nyou want to see her fling herself, in your opinion, the rational\ncondition, fortunate or fatal, of a girl without a dowry and without an\nancestry? See! did you not mock me this very morning, when you wished to\npersuade me that you would marry her! And this is what you said only a\nmoment ago: \'It is you who are in love with her. For me, it was only a\nfancy, an idle, selfish vanity.\' Come, it is frightful,--this libertine\nvanity of yours! It drags down into the mire all that comes near you!\nYour very gaze soils a woman, and it is too much for me already that\nthis girl has undergone the insult of your thoughts. I love her no\nlonger.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus to his brother for the first time in his life, the\nMarquis rose and strode away from him swiftly with a kind of gloomy\nhatred and with a curse seemingly irrevocable.\n\nThe Duke, beside himself, arose immediately to demand satisfaction. He\neven took a few steps in pursuit of his brother, then stopped abruptly\nand returned, throwing himself down on the spot which Urbain had just\nleft. He was the victim of a terrible conflict; irritated, furious, he\nstill felt that the person of the Marquis was sacred to him; he was not\nin the habit of rendering to himself a just account of his own faults,\nand yet in spite of himself, he felt none the less overwhelmed by the\nlanguage of truth. He wrung his hands convulsively, and great tears of\nrage and grief flowed down his cheeks.\n\nAndré came to find him, having been sent by his mother. The visitors\nwere gone, but Madame d\'Arglade had arrived. They were astonished not to\nsee him. The Marchioness, knowing that he had ridden Blanche, was afraid\nthat the unfortunate horse might have been crushed under him.\n\nHe followed the servant mechanically, and asked, just as he was going\ninto the house, \"Where is M. de Villemer?\"\n\n\"In his room, your Grace. I saw him go in.\"\n\n\"And Mlle de Saint-Geneix?\"\n\n\"She has also gone to her room; but Madame the Marchioness has informed\nher of the arrival of Madame d\'Arglade, and she will come down again\nsoon.\"\n\n\"Very good! Go tell M. de Villemer that I wish to speak with him. In ten\nminutes I will go up to his room.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMadame d\'Arglade was the wife of a great provincial dignitary. She had\nobtained an introduction to the Marchioness de Villemer at the South,\nwhen the latter was passing the summer there upon a large estate, since\nsold to pay the debts of her eldest son. Madame d\'Arglade had that\nparticular kind of narrow and persevering ambition of which certain\nwives of officials, small or great, furnish quite remarkable specimens.\nTo rise in order to shine, and to shine in order to rise,--that was the\nsole thought, the sole dream, the sole talent, the sole principle of\nthis little woman. Rich, and without an ancestry to boast of, she had\nbestowed her dowry upon a ruined noble to serve as security for a place\nin the department of finance, and to add splendor to her house; for she\nunderstood perfectly well that, in that condition of life, the best way\nto acquire a large fortune was to begin by having one suitable to her\nposition and by spending it liberally. Plump, active, pretty, cool, and\nadroit, she considered a certain amount of coquetry as a duty of her\nstation, and secretly prided herself upon the lofty science which\nconsists in promising with the eyes but never with the pen or the lips,\nin making transient impressions, but calling forth no abiding\nattachments, and, lastly, in gaining her objects by surprise, without\nappearing to hold them, and never descending to ask for them, that she\nmight find herself supported on all occasions by useful friends, she\ngathered them up everywhere, received every one with no great nicety of\nchoice, with a well-acted good-nature or thoughtlessness, and, in fine,\nshe penetrated skilfully into the most exclusive families and was not\nlong in contriving to become indispensable to them.\n\nIt was thus that Madame d\'Arglade had wormed herself into what was\nalmost an intimacy with Madame de Villemer, in spite of the prejudice of\nthat noble lady against her origin, her position, and the occupation of\nher husband; but Léonie d\'Arglade paraded her own complete lack of\npolitical opinions, and dexterously went round begging pardon of every\none for her utter incapacity and nothingness in this regard,--which was\nher expedient to shock no one, and to make people forget the compulsory\nzeal of her husband for the cause he served. She was gay, heedless,\nsometimes silly, laughing loudly at herself, but inwardly laughing at\nthe simplicity of others, and managing to pass for the most ingenuous\nand disinterested creature in the world, while all her proceedings were\nbased on calculation, and all her impulses were premeditated.\n\nShe had very well understood that a certain class of society, however\ndivided in opinion it may be, is always held together by some\nindissoluble tie of kinship or expediency, and that, upon occasion, all\nits shades of difference are blended by one animating spirit of caste or\nof common interest. She was quite well aware, then, that she needed\nacquaintance with the Faubourg St. Germain, where her husband was not\nusually admitted, and, thanks to Madame de Villemer, whose good-nature\nshe had adroitly captivated by her prattle and untiring \"availability,\"\nshe had gained a foothold in certain drawing-rooms, where she pleased\npeople and passed for an amiable child of no great consequence.\n\nThis child was already twenty-eight years old and did not appear more\nthan twenty-two or twenty-three, although balls were a little fatiguing\nto her; she had managed to preserve so much engaging sauciness and\nsimplicity that no one perceived her growing a trifle too fleshy. She\nshowed her little dazzling teeth when she smiled, lisped in her speech,\nand seemed intoxicated with dress and pleasure. In fine, no one\nsuspected her and perhaps there was really nothing to dread in her,\nsince her first interest was to appear good-natured and to make herself\ninoffensive; but it required great exertion in any one who did not want\nto find himself suddenly entangled with her.\n\nIt was in this way that, without being on her guard and all the while\ndeclaring that she would take no step to influence the ministry of the\ncitizen king, Madame de Villemer had found herself inveigled into\naffecting more or less directly Léonie\'s withdrawal from her province.\nThanks to Madame de Villemer and to the Duke d\'Aléria, M. d\'Arglade had\njust received an appointment in Paris, and his wife had written to the\nMarchioness:--\n\n\"Dear Madame, I owe to you my life; you are my guardian angel. I quit\nthe South, and I shall only touch at Paris; for, before establishing\nmyself there, before beginning to rejoice and amuse myself, before\neverything, in a word, I want to go and thank you and prostrate myself\nbefore you at Séval for twenty-four hours, and tell you during those\ntwenty-four hours how much I love you and bless you.\n\n\"I will be with you on the 10th of June. Say to his Grace the Duke that\nit will be the 9th or the 11th, and that, in the mean time, I thank him\nfor having been so kind to my husband, who is going to write him on his\nown account.\"\n\nThis pretended uncertainty as to the day of her arrival was, on the part\nof Madame d\'Arglade, the graceful reception of a joke which the Duke had\noften made about the ignorance of days and hours that she always\naffected. The Duke, with all his cunning with regard to women, had been\ncompletely duped by Léonie. He thought her silly, and had a way of\naddressing her thus: \"That\'s it! You are coming to see my mother to-day,\nMonday, Tuesday, or Sunday, the seventh, sixth, or fifth day of the\nmonth of November, September, or December, in your blue or gray or\nrose-colored dress, and you are going to honor us by supping, dining, or\nbreakfasting with us, or with them, or with other people.\"\n\nThe Duke was not at all taken with her. She amused him, and the small\ntalk and witticism which characterized his manner with her were merely\nas a mask for a sort of desultory groping about in the dark, which\nMadame d\'Arglade pretended not to notice, but of which she knew very\nwell how to keep clear.\n\nWhen the Duke entered the presence of Madame d\'Arglade and his mother,\nhe was still much disturbed, and the change in his countenance struck\nthe Marchioness. \"Bless me!\" cried she, \"there has been some accident!\"\n\n\"None at all, dear mother. Reassure yourself; everything has passed off\nfinely. I have been a little cold, that is all.\"\n\nHe was really cold, although he had still on his brow the perspiration\nof vexation and anger. He drew near the fire which burned every evening,\nat all seasons of the year, in the drawing-room of the Marchioness; but,\nafter a few moments, the habit of self-mastery, which is the whole\nscience of fashionable life, and the brilliant pyrotechnics of Léonie\'s\nwords and smiles, dispelled his bitterness.\n\nMlle de Saint-Geneix now came forward to embrace her old companion at\nthe convent. \"Ah! but you are pale too,\" said the Marchioness to\nCaroline. \"You are concealing something from me! There has been some\naccident--I am sure of it--with those infernal beasts.\"\n\n\"No, Madame,\" replied Caroline, \"none at all, I assure you, and, to\nrelieve your anxiety, I will tell you everything: I have been very much\nfrightened.\"\n\n\"Really? By what, pray?\" asked the Duke; \"it certainly was not by your\nhorse?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was by you, your Grace. Come, was it you who stopped my\nhorse for sport, while I was alone walking him slowly in the green\navenue?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, it was I,\" replied the Duke. \"I wanted to see whether you\nwere as brave as you seemed.\"\n\n\"And I was not. I ran like a terrified chicken.\"\n\n\"But you did not cry out, and you did not lose your presence of\nmind,--that\'s something.\"\n\nThey told Madame d\'Arglade about the horseback ride. As was her custom,\nshe pretended to take very little notice of what was said; but she lost\nnot a word, and asked herself earnestly whether the Duke had deceived or\nwanted to deceive Caroline, and whether this combination might not be\nuseful in some way at a future day. The Duke left the ladies together,\nand went up to his brother\'s room.\n\nThe reason why Caroline and Léonie were not intimate at the convent was\nthe difference in their ages. Four years establish a very considerable\nbarrier in youth. Caroline had not wished to tell the Duke the true\nreason, fearing to seem desirous to make her companion appear old, fully\naware besides, that it is doing an ill-turn to most pretty women to\nrecollect their ages too faithfully. It is also worth mention, that all\nthe time Madame d\'Arglade remained at Séval, she passed for the\nyounger, and that Caroline, like a good girl, allowed this error of\nmemory to go uncontradicted.\n\nCaroline then, in reality, knew very little about her protectress; she\nhad never met her since the time, when, as a child upon the benches of\nthe \"little class,\" she had seen Mlle Léonie Lecompte emerge from the\nconvent, eager to marry some man of birth or position, regretting no\none, but, already shrewd and calculating, bidding every one a tender\nfarewell. Caroline and Camille de Saint-Geneix, at that period girls of\ngentle blood and comfortable fortune, might, she thought, be good\nacquaintances to find again at some future time. She wrote them, in a\nvery compassionate tone, therefore, when she learned of their father\'s\ndeath. In her reply Caroline did not conceal the fact that she was left\nnot only an orphan but penniless, Madame d\'Arglade took good care not to\ndesert her friend in her misfortunes. Other convent mates, of whom she\nsaw more, had told her that both the Saint-Geneix were charming, and\nthat, with her talents and beauty, Caroline would be sure to make a good\nmatch nevertheless,--the idle talk of inexperienced young women. Léonie\nthought, indeed, that they were mistaken; but she might try to marry off\nCaroline, and in that way find herself mixed up in confidential\nquestions, and in intimate negotiations with divers families. From that\ntime she thought of nothing but gaining many supporters, extending her\nrelations everywhere, and obtaining the secrets of others while\npretending to impart her own. She wanted to attract Caroline to her\nhouse in her province, offering her with a delicate grace, a refuge and\na prospective home of her own. Caroline, touched by so much kindness,\nreplied that she could not leave her sister, and did not wish to marry,\nbut that if she should ever find herself painfully situated, she would\nappeal to Léonie\'s generous heart to seek out for her some modest\nemployment.\n\nFrom that time Léonie, always full of promises and praises, saw plainly\nthat Caroline did not understand a life of expedients, and troubled\nherself no further about her, until some old friends, who perhaps pitied\nCaroline more sincerely, informed Léonie that she was seeking a place\nas governess in a quiet family, or as reader to some intelligent old\nlady. Léonie loved to use her influence, and always had something to\nask for some one; it was an opportunity for her to get into notice, and\nto make herself agreeable. Finding herself in Paris at the time, she\nmade greater haste than any one else did, and in her search fell upon\nthe Marchioness de Villemer, who had just then dismissed her reader. She\nwanted an elderly lady. Madame d\'Arglade expatiated on the disadvantages\nof old age, which had made Esther so crabbed. She also diminished as\nmuch as she could the youth and beauty of Caroline. She was a girl about\nthirty, pretty enough in other days, but who had suffered and must have\nfaded. Then she wrote to Caroline to describe the Marchioness, urging\nher to come quickly, and offering to share her own temporary lodgings in\nParis with her. We have seen that Caroline did not find her at home, but\nintroduced herself to the Marchioness, astonished the latter with her\nbeauty, and charmed her with her frankness, doing by the charm and\nascendency of her appearance more than Léonie had ever hoped for her.\n\nUpon seeing Léonie stout, flaunting, and shrewd, but having still\npreserved her girlish ways, and even exaggerated her childish lisping,\nCaroline was astonished and asked herself at first sight if all this was\nnot affected; but she was soon to change her mind good-naturedly, and to\nshare in the delusion of every one else. Madame d\'Arglade was charmingly\npolite to her, and all the more so because she had already questioned\nthe Marchioness about Mlle de Saint-Geneix, and knew her to be well\nanchored in the good graces of the old lady. Madame de Villemer declared\nher perfect in all respects, quick and discreet, frank and gentle, of\nunusual intelligence and the noblest character. She had warmly thanked\nMadame d\'Arglade for having procured her this \"pearl of the Orient,\" and\nMadame d\'Arglade had said to herself, \"Well and good! I see that\nCaroline can be useful to me; she is so already. It is always well not\nto despise or neglect any one.\" And she overwhelmed the young lady with\ncaresses and flatteries, which seemed as unstudied as the affectionate\nrapture of a school-girl.\n\n\nJust before going to his brother\'s room, the Duke, who was resolved upon\na reconciliation, walked for five minutes on the lawn. Involuntary fits\nof wrath returned upon him, and he feared that he might not be master of\nhimself, if the Marquis should renew his admonitions. At last he came to\na decision, went up stairs, crossed a long vestibule, hearing his blood\nbeat so loudly in his temples as to conceal the sound of his footsteps.\n\nUrbain was alone at the farther end of the library, a long room in the\nogive style, with slender arches, which his small lamp lighted but\nfeebly. He was not reading; but hearing the approach of the Duke, he had\nplaced a book before himself, ashamed of appearing unable to work.\n\nThe Duke stopped to look at him before saying a word. His dull paleness,\nand his eyes hollow with suffering, touched the Duke deeply. He was\ngoing to offer his hand, when the Marquis rose and said to him in a\ngrave voice: \"My brother, I offended you very much an hour ago. I was\nunjust probably, and, in any case, I had no right to remonstrate with\nyou,--I who, having loved but one woman in my whole life, have yet been\nthe guilty cause of her ruin and her death. I confess the absurdity, the\nharshness, the arrogance of my words, and I sincerely beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I thank you with all my heart,\" replied Gaëtan, taking him\nby both hands; \"you are doing me a great kindness, for I had resolved to\nmake an apology to you. The deuce take me, if I know what for! But I\nsaid to myself, that in wrestling with you under the trees, I must have\nexcited your nerves. Perhaps I hurt you; my hand is heavy. Why didn\'t\nyou speak to me? And then--and then--Come, I had been causing you much\nsuffering, and perhaps for a long time, without knowing it; but I could\nnot guess,--I ought to have suspected it, though, and I, too, sincerely\nbeg your pardon for that, my poor brother. Ah! why did you lack\nconfidence in me after what we had both solemnly promised?\"\n\n\"Have confidence in you!\" rejoined the Marquis; \"do you not see that\nthis is my greatest need, my keenest thirst, and that my wrath was only\ngrief? I wept for it, this confidence that was put in question, I wept\nbitter tears for it. Give it back to me; I cannot do without it.\"\n\n\"What must I do? Tell me, do tell me! I am ready to go through fire and\nwater! It is only the trial by water which I beg you to spare. What if I\nshould be called upon to drink it!\"\n\n\"Ah! you laugh at everything; do you not see that you do?\"\n\n\"I laugh--I laugh--because it is my way of being pleased, and from the\nmoment you love me again, the rest is nothing. And then what is there so\nvery serious? You love this charming girl. You are not wrong. Do you\nwish me never to speak to her, and never to meet her, or never to look\nat her? It shall be done, I swear, it, and if this is not enough, I will\nset out to-morrow, or now, if you like, on Blanche. I don\'t see what\nworse thing I can do?\"\n\n\"No, no, don\'t go away, don\'t desert me! Do you not see, Gaëtan, that I\nam dying?\"\n\n\"My God! why do you say that?\" cried the Duke, lifting up the shade of\nthe lamp and looking his brother in the face; then he seized the hands\nof the Marquis, and, not finding the pulse readily, laid both his own on\nhis brother\'s chest, and felt the disordered and uneven beating of the\ninvalid\'s heart.\n\nThis disease had seriously threatened the life of the Marquis in his\nearly youth. It had disappeared, leaving a delicate complexion, a great\ndeal of nervous uneasiness, with sudden reactions of strength, but, on\nthe whole, as great certitude of life as a hundred others have who are\napparently more energetic and really less finely tempered, less\nsustained by a healthy will and the power of discrimination. This time,\nhowever, the old disease had reappeared, with violence enough to justify\nthe alarm of Gaëtan and to produce in his brother the oppression and\nthe awful sensations of a death-agony.\n\n\"Not a word to my mother!\" said the Marquis, rising and going to open\nthe window. \"It is not to-morrow that I shall sink under this. I have\nsome strength still; I do not give myself up yet. Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Why, I am going to get a horse. I am going for a physician.\"\n\n\"Where? For whom? There is not one here who knows my constitution so\nwell as not to run a risk of killing me, should he undertake my case in\nthe name of his logic. If I should fail, take care not to leave me to\nany village Esculapius, and remember that bleeding will carry me off as\nthe wind carries away an autumn leaf. I was doctored enough ten years\nago to know what I need, and I am in the habit of taking care of myself.\nCome, do not doubt this,\" added he, showing the Duke some powders\nprepared in doses, from a drawer in his bureau. \"Here are quieting and\nstimulating medicines, which I know how to use variously. I perfectly\nunderstand my disease and its treatment. Be sure that, if I can be\ncured, I shall be cured, and that, to this end, I shall do all that\nought to be done by a man who knows the extent of his duties. Be calm.\nIt was my duty to tell you what I am threatened with, so that you might\nthoroughly forgive in your heart my feverish anger. Keep my secret for\nme; we must not uselessly alarm our poor mother. If the time to prepare\nher should arrive, I shall feel it and will give you warning. Until\nthen, be calm, I beg of you!\"\n\n\"Calm! It is you who must be calm,\" retorted the Duke, \"and here you are\nfighting with a passion! It is passion that has awakened this poor heart\nphysically as well as morally. It is love, it is happiness, enthusiasm,\ntenderness, that you need. Well, nothing is lost then. Tell me, do you\nwish her to love you, this girl? She shall love you. What am I saying?\nShe does love you, she has always loved you, from the very first day.\nNow I recall the whole. I see plainly. It is you--\"\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" said the Marquis, falling back into his arm-chair. \"I\ncannot hear it; it stifles me.\"\n\nBut after a momentary silence, during which the Duke watched him with\nanxiety, he seemed better, and said with a smile, which restored to his\nexpressive face all its youthful charm,--\n\n\"And yet what you said then was true! It is perhaps love. Perhaps it is\nnothing else. You have soothed me with an illusion, and I have given\nmyself up to it like a child. Feel of my heart now; it is refreshed. The\ndream has passed over it like a cool breeze.\"\n\n\"Since you are feeling better,\" said the Duke, after making sure that he\nwas really calm, \"you ought to make the most of it and try to sleep. You\ndo not sleep, and that is dreadful! In the morning, when I start for a\nhunt, I often see your lamp still burning.\"\n\n\"And yet, for many nights past, I have not been at work.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if it is sleeplessness, you shall not keep watch alone; I\nwill answer for that. Let me see; you are going to lie down, to lie down\non your bed.\"\n\n\"It is impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see: you would suffocate. Well, you shall sit up and sleep. I\nwill stay close by. I will talk to you about her until you no longer\nhear me.\"\n\nThe Duke conducted his brother to his room, placed him in a large\narm-chair, took care of him as a mother would take care of her child,\nand seated himself near him, holding his hand in his own. Then all\nUrbain\'s natural kindliness returned, and he said, gratefully,--\n\n\"I have been hateful this evening. Tell me again that you forgive me.\"\n\n\"I do what is better: I love you,\" replied Gaëtan; \"and I am not the\nonly one, either. She is also thinking about you at this very hour.\"\n\n\"O Heaven! you are lying. You are lulling me with a celestial song; but\nyou are lying. She loves no one; she will never love me!\"\n\n\"Do you want me to go after her and tell her that you are seriously ill?\nI\'ll wager that in five minutes she would be here!\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" replied the Marquis, with languid gentleness. \"She is\nfull of charity and devotedness; but it would be worse for me to\nascertain that I had her pity--and nothing more.\"\n\n\"Bah! you know nothing about it. Pity is the beginning of love.\nEverything must begin with something which is not quite the middle or\nthe end. If you would let yourself be guided by me, in a week you would\nsee--\"\n\n\"Ah! now you are doing me more harm still. If it were as easy as you\nthink to win her love, I should not long for it so ardently.\"\n\n\"Very well. The illusion would be dispelled. You would regain your peace\nof mind. That would be something at least.\"\n\n\"It would be my death, Gaëtan,\" resumed the Marquis, growing animated\nand recovering strength in his voice. \"How unhappy I am that you cannot\nunderstand me! But there is an abyss between us. Take care, my poor\nfriend, with an imprudence, or a slight levity, or a mistaken\ndevotedness, you can kill me as quickly as if you held a pistol to my\nhead.\"\n\nThe Duke was very much puzzled. He found the situation simple enough,\nbetween two persons more or less attracted toward each other and\nseparated only by scruples, which had little importance in his eyes; but\nin his opinion, Urbain was complicating this situation by whimsical\ndelicacy. If Mlle de Saint-Geneix should accept him without really\nloving him, the Marquis felt that his own love for her would die, and in\nthe loss of this love which was killing him, the thunderbolt would fall\nthe quicker. This was a sort of blind alley which drove the Duke\nwellnigh to despair, but into which it was none the less necessary\nrespectfully to follow his brother\'s wishes and ideas. By conversing\nlonger with him, and sounding him to the very depths of his being,\nGaëtan reached the conclusion that the only joy it was possible to give\nhim would consist in aiding him to a knowledge of Caroline\'s affection\nand to a hope of its patient and delicate growth. So long as his\nimagination could wander through this garden of early emotions, romantic\nand pure, the Marquis was lulled by pleasant ideas and exquisite joys.\nAs soon, however, as he saw the uncertain approach of the hour when he\nmust decide upon his course and risk an avowal, he felt a dark\npresentiment of an inevitable disaster, and, unhappily for him, he was\nnot mistaken. Caroline would refuse him and take to flight, or, if she\nshould accept his hand, his aged mother would be driven to despair and\nperhaps sink under the loss of her illusions.\n\nThe Duke plunged deeply into these reflections, for Urbain began to\ndrowse, after having made him promise that he would leave to get some\nrest himself as soon as he should see him fairly asleep. Gaëtan was\nvexed at finding no way to be of real service to him. He would have\nliked to tell Caroline the danger, to appeal to her kindliness and her\nesteem, asking her to humor the moral condition of the invalid, veiling\nthe future to him, whatever it might be, and soothing him with vague\nhopes and fair dreams; but this would be pushing the poor girl down a\nvery dangerous slope, and she was not so childish as not to understand\nthat she would thus risk her reputation and probably her own peace of\nmind.\n\nDestiny, which is very active in dramas of this kind, since it always\nmeets with souls predisposed to yield to its action, did what the Duke\ndared not do.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nNotwithstanding the promise made to his brother, to inform no one of his\ncondition, the Duke could not quite make up his mind to assume the\ndangerous responsibility of absolute silence. He believed in a doctor,\nwhoever he might be, in spite of his assertion that he did not believe\nin medicine, and he resolved to go to Chambon and make arrangements with\na young man there who did not appear to him to be lacking either in\nknowledge or prudence, one day when he himself had consulted him about a\nslight indisposition. Under the seal of secrecy he would confide the\nsituation of the Marquis to this young physician, and engage him to come\nto the manor-house the next day, under the pretext of selling a bit of\nprairie enclosed in the lands of Séval. Then he would bring about a\nchance for the doctor to see the patient, if only to observe his face\nand general symptoms, without giving any professional advice; a way of\nsubmitting this advice to M. de Villemer would be found, and perhaps he\nwould consent to follow it. In a word the Duke, who could not endure to\nwatch through the loneliness and silence of the night, felt the need of\ndoing something to calm his own anxiety. He calculated that he could\nreach Chambon in a half-hour, and that an additional hour would give him\ntime to rouse the physician, talk with him, and return. He could, he\nought, to be back before his brother, who now seemed resting quietly,\nshould awake from his first sleep.\n\nThe Duke withdrew noiselessly, left the house through the garden so as\nto be heard by no one, and descended quickly toward the bed of the river\nto a foot-bridge by the mill, and to a path which led him straight to\nthe town. By taking a horse and following the road, he would have made a\nnoise and gained very little time. The Marquis, however, did not sleep\nso soundly as not to hear him leave the room; but, knowing nothing of\nhis project, and not wishing to hinder his brother from going to rest,\nhe had pretended to be unconscious of everything.\n\nIt was then a little after midnight. Madame d\'Arglade, after having\ntaken her leave of the Marchioness, had followed Caroline to her room to\nhave a little more talk with her. \"Well now, pretty dear,\" she said,\n\"are you really as well satisfied in this house as you say? Be frank\nwith me, if anything troubles you here. Ah, bless me! there is always\nsome little thing in the way. Take advantage of my presence now to\nconfide it to me. I have some influence with the Marchioness, without\nhaving sought for it, to be sure; but she likes silly heads, and then I,\nwho am naturally of a happy disposition, and never need anything for\nmyself,--I have the right to serve my friends unhesitatingly.\"\n\n\"You are very good,\" replied Caroline; \"but here everybody is good to\nme, too, and if I had anything to complain of I should speak of it quite\nfreely.\"\n\n\"That\'s right, thank you,\" exclaimed Léonie, taking the promise as made\nto herself. \"Well, now, how about the Duke? Has he never teased you, the\nhandsome Duke?\"\n\n\"Very little, and that is all over with now.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you give me pleasure by saying that. Do you know that after\nhaving written to you to engage you for this place I felt a certain\nremorse of conscience? I had never spoken to you of this great\nconqueror.\"\n\n\"It is true you seemed to have a fear of speaking to me about him.\"\n\n\"A fear! no, I had entirely forgotten him; I am so giddy-headed! I said\nto myself, \'Heavens! I hope that Mlle de Saint-Geneix will not be\nannoyed by his artifices!\' for he has his artifices and with everybody.\"\n\n\"He has had none with me, I am thankful to be able to say.\"\n\n\"Then all is well,\" replied Léonie, who did not believe a word of what\nshe heard. She changed the subject to that of dress, and all at once she\nexclaimed, \"O, bless me! how sleepy I am becoming! It must be on account\nof the journey. Till to-morrow, then, dear Caroline. Are you an early\nriser?\"\n\n\"Yes; are you?\"\n\n\"Alas! not much of a one; but when I do get my eyes open, say, between\nten and eleven, I shall find you in your room,--shall I not?\"\n\nShe retired, resolved to get up early in the morning, wander about\neverywhere as if by chance, and obtain a stealthy knowledge of all the\nmost intimate details of the family affairs, Caroline followed her to\ninstall her in her apartment, and returned to her own little room, which\nwas some distance from that of the Marquis, but whose casements, looking\nout on the lawn, were almost opposite to his.\n\nBefore going to rest, she put in order certain books and papers, for she\nstudied a great deal, and with a genuine relish; she heard it strike one\no\'clock in the morning, and went to shut her blinds before disrobing. At\nthat moment she heard a sharp stroke against the glass of the opposite\ncasement, and her eyes, following the direction of the sound, saw a pane\nfall rattling from the lighted window of the Marquis. Astonished by this\naccident, and by the silence which followed, Caroline listened\nattentively. No one stirred; no one had heard it. Gradually, confused\nsounds reached her, feeble plaints at first, and then stifled cries and\na species of rattle. \"Some one is assassinating the Marquis,\" was her\nfirst thought, for the sinister murmurs came evidently from his room.\nWhat should she do? Call, find some one, tell the Duke who lodged still\nfarther away?--all that would take too much time, and, besides, under\nthe oppression of such a warning there must be no indecision. Caroline\nmeasured the distance with her eye: there were twenty paces to go across\nthe grass. If malefactors had penetrated to M. de Villemer\'s room it\nmust have been by the stairs of the Griffin turret which was opposite to\nthat of the Fox. These two cages with stairways in them bore the names\nof the emblems rudely sculptured on the tympans of their portals. The\nstairs of the Fox led away on this side from Caroline\'s room. No one\nelse could arrive on the scene so soon as she could, and her solitary\napproach might cause the assassins to release the Marquis. In the\nGriffin turret there was besides the rope of a little alarm bell. She\nsaid all this to herself while running, and by the time she had finished\nsaying it, she had reached this door, which she found open. The Duke had\ngone out there, intending to return in the same way without causing the\nhinges to creak, and thinking nothing about robbers, an unknown class in\nthat country.\n\nCaroline, however, all the more confirmed in the imaginary construction\nshe had put upon the matter, bounded up the spiral stairway of stone.\nHearing nothing at all there, she advanced along the passage, and\nstopped hesitating, before the door of the Marquis\'s apartment. She\nventured to knock, but received no answer. There were certainly no\nassassins near her, yet what were the cries which she had heard? An\naccident of some kind, but undoubtedly a serious one, and one which made\nimmediate assistance necessary. She pushed open the door, that was not\neven latched, and found M. de Villemer extended upon the floor, near the\nwindow which he had not had strength enough to open, and of which he had\nbroken the glass to gain air, feeling himself overwhelmed by a sudden\nstrangling.\n\nThe Marquis had not fainted. He had had the terrors of death; he now\nfelt the return of his breathing and of life. As he had his face turned\ntowards the window, he did not see Caroline enter, but he heard her, and\nthinking it was the Duke, \"Do not be alarmed,\" he said, in a feeble\nvoice; \"it is passing off. Aid me to rise, I have no longer the\nstrength.\"\n\nCaroline rushed forward and raised him up with the energy of an\noverexcited will. It was only when he found himself again in his chair\nthat he recognized her, or thought he recognized her, for his sight,\nstill dim, was crossed by blue waves, and his limbs were so cold and\nrigid that they were insensible to the touch of the arms and dress of\nCaroline.\n\n\"Heaven! is it a dream?\" he said, with a sort of wildness. \"You! is it\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly it is I,\" she answered; \"I heard you groan. What is the\nmatter? What shall I do? Call your brother, must I not? But I dare not\nleave you again. How do you feel? What has happened to you?\"\n\n\"My brother,\" rejoined the Marquis, rousing himself enough to recover\nhis memory. \"Ah! it was he who led you here. Where is he?\"\n\n\"He is not about; he knows nothing of this.\"\n\n\"You have not seen him?\"\n\n\"No, I will go and have him called.\"\n\n\"Ah! do not leave me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will not; but to aid you--\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing! I know what it is; it is nothing. Do not be alarmed;\nyou see I am quiet. And--you are here!--and you knew nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing in the world. For some days I have found you changed--I\nthought, indeed, that you were ill, but I dared not be anxious--\"\n\n\"And now at this moment--did I call you?--What--what did I say?\"\n\n\"Nothing. You broke this window-pane in falling perhaps. Has it not\nwounded you?\"\n\nAnd Caroline, approaching the light, took up and examined the hands of\nthe Marquis. The right one was quite badly cut: she washed away the\nblood, adroitly removed the particles of glass, and dressed the wound.\nUrbain submitted, regarding her with the mingled astonishment and\ntenderness of a man who, picked up on the battle-field, discovers\nhimself in friendly hands. He repeated feebly, \"My brother, then, has\ntold you nothing,--is it true?\"\n\nShe did not at all understand this question, which seemed to have gained\nthe fixedness of a diseased fancy, and to banish it she recounted to\nhim, while binding up his hand, that she had believed him in the hands\nof assassins. \"It was absurd, to be sure,\" she said, forcing herself to\nbe cheerful; \"but how could I help it? That fear took possession of me,\nand I ran hither, as to a fire, without informing any one.\"\n\n\"And if that had been really the case, you were coming here to expose\nyourself to danger?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I never thought of myself; I thought only of you and your\nmother. Nonsense! I would have helped you to defend yourself; I don\'t\nknow how, or with what, but I would have found something; I would have\nmade a diversion at any rate. There, your wound is dressed, and it will\nbe nothing; but the other, what is the nature of it? You do not wish to\ntell me? Your friends must nevertheless know how to help you; your\nbrother--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, the Duke knows all, my mother nothing.\"\n\n\"I understand you do not wish--I will tell her nothing; but you will\npermit me to be anxious; to try and find with the Duke what ought to be\ndone to relieve you. I will not be troublesome. I know how one should be\nwith those who suffer. I was the nurse of my poor father and of my\nsister\'s husband. See now, do not take it ill that I came here\nunwittingly and without reflection. You could have arisen from the floor\nyourself, I know very well; but it is a sad thing to suffer alone. You\nsmile? Come, M. de Villemer, it seems to me that you are a little\nbetter. O, how much I want you to be!\"\n\n\"I am in heaven,\" replied the Marquis, and, as he had no idea of the\nhour, \"Stay a while longer,\" he said. \"My brother watched with me a\nlittle this evening; he will return.\"\n\nCaroline did not allow herself to make any objection; she simply did not\nconsider at all what the Duke might think when he found her there, or\nwhat the servants would say if they saw her going back to her room; in\nthe presence of a friend in danger, the possibility of any insulting\nsuspicion had not even occurred to her. She remained.\n\nThe Marquis wished to say more to her, but had not the strength. \"Do not\nspeak,\" she said. \"Try to sleep; I solemnly promise that I will not\nleave you.\"\n\n\"What? You want me to sleep? But I cannot. When I fall asleep I\nstrangle.\"\n\n\"And yet you are overcome with fatigue; your eyes close in your own\ndespite. Well, now you must obey nature. If you have another severe\nattack I will help you to bear it; I shall be here.\"\n\nThe confidence and good-will of Caroline had a magical effect upon the\ninvalid. He fell asleep and rested peacefully till day. Caroline had\nseated herself near a table, and knew now the nature of his malady and\nhow to care for it, for upon that table she had found a diagnosis of the\ncase with simple, intelligible rules for its treatment signed by one of\nthe first physicians of France. The Marquis, to relieve his brother from\nany anxiety he might have as to his manner of treating himself, had\nshown him that document invested with the authority of a great name, and\nthe document had remained there under the hand, under the eyes of\nCaroline, who studied it very carefully. She perceived that the Marquis\nhad been, since she had known him, living under a regimen quite opposed\nto the one there prescribed: he took no exercise, he ate stintingly, and\nwent with too little sleep. She did not know but that this relapse would\nbe mortal; but if it were not, she resolved to be on her guard in the\nfuture and to be bold enough to watch over his health, even if he still\nhad that gloomy, cold manner toward her which she now attributed to an\nanguish altogether physical.\n\nThe Duke returned before sunrise. He had not found the physician; he had\nto go and look for him at Évaux. Before starting thither, he wanted to\nsee his brother. The dawn was streaking the horizon with its first lines\nof white when he noiselessly regained the apartment of the Marquis. The\nlatter was then sleeping so soundly that he did not hear the ascending\nfootsteps, and Caroline could go out to meet the Duke upon the stairway,\nso that he should utter no exclamation of surprise at sight of her. His\nsurprise was indeed great when he saw her coming down toward him with\nher finger to her lips. He understood nothing of what had passed. He\nthought that the Marquis had concealed the truth from him, that she was\naware of his love, his sorrow, and that she had come to console him.\n\n\"Ah! my dear friend,\" taking her hands, \"be at ease; he has confided all\nto me. You have come, you are good, you will save him;\" and he carried\nCaroline\'s hands to his lips with genuine affection.\n\n\"But,\" said she, slightly astonished, \"knowing him to be so ill, why did\nyou leave him to-night? And since you counted upon my care for him, why\ndid you not tell me it was needed?\"\n\n\"What, then, has happened?\" asked the Duke, who perceived that they did\nnot understand each other. She told him briefly what had occurred, and\nas, absorbed by what he was hearing, he conducted her back across the\ngrass-plot to the stairs of the Fox turret, Madame d\'Arglade, who was\nalready upon her feet behind the casement of her window, saw them pass,\ntalking in a low voice with an air of mysterious intimacy. They stopped\nbefore the door, and stood talking awhile longer. The Duke gave Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix an account of his attempt to bring a physician to see his\nbrother, and Caroline dissuaded him from that design. She believed that\nthe directions she had read would be sufficient, and that it would be\nhighly imprudent to adopt a new treatment when they were aware that the\nfirst one had been attended with beneficial results. The Duke readily\npromised her to conform to this advice, and consequently to have\nconfidence in it. Madame d\'Arglade saw them take each other by the hand\nat parting, and the Duke, retracing his steps, ascend the stairs of the\nGriffin turret.\n\n\"Very well, I have seen enough,\" thought Léonie; \"and I have n\'t to run\nabout in the dew, which I don\'t like to do at all; I can lie abed the\nwhole forenoon.\" And in getting herself to sleep again; \"That Caroline!\"\nshe said to herself, \"I see plainly that she lied. How probable it is\nthat the Duke would allow her to go free! But I will keep it, this fine\nsecret of hers, and if ever I have need of her, she will of course have\nto do as I wish.\"\n\nCaroline retired quickly, that she might get quickly to sleep, so as to\nreturn to the service of her patient.\n\nAt eight o\'clock she was up and looked through her window. The Duke was\nat that of his brother. He made her a sign that he would go through the\nhalls and meet her in the library. She went thither immediately from her\nside of the house, and there she learned that the Marquis was remarkably\nwell. He had just awakened, and he had said, \"Heavens, what a miracle!\nThis is my first sleep after a whole week of this suffering, and I no\nlonger feel any pain; I breathe freely; it seems to me that I am cured.\nIt is to her that I owe it all!\"--\"and it is the truth, my dear friend,\"\nadded the Duke; \"it is you who have saved him, and who will preserve him\nfor us, if you have pity upon us.\"\n\nThe Duke had resolved to say nothing; he had sworn it to his brother;\nbut, although thinking himself very discreet, he had let the truth\nescape him in his own despite. That truth darted through the mind of\nCaroline like a flash of lightning. \"What is it that your Grace says?\"\ncried she. \"Who am I, and how am I here to have such an influence?\"\n\nThe Duke himself was frightened by the frightened look of Caroline.\n\"Come, in whom are you disappointed?\" he said, resuming the mask of his\ntranquil smile. \"What is that you have got into your head now? Do you\nnot see that I worship my brother, that I am in great fear of losing\nhim, and that, because of the assistance you were to him last night, I\nspeak to you as if you were my sister? I am very much embarrassed; I\nlose my senses, do you see? Urbain is killing himself with work. My\ninfluence over him is not sufficient; he does not want me to inform our\nmother of the return of his old disorder. Informing her would be indeed\nto agitate her dangerously; infirm as she is, she would be always with\nhim to watch. At the end of two nights she would succumb to her\nexertions. It remains for us two, therefore, to save my brother, without\nseeming to do so, without taking the lackeys and chambermaids into our\nconfidence. That sort of people will always talk. Come, are you a woman\nof heart and head as I have persuaded myself that you are? Will you, can\nyou, dare you, seriously, aid me to nurse him in secret, and watch\nalternately with me for several evenings, several nights if necessary,\nnever leaving him alone an hour, so that even for an hour he cannot\nbetake himself again to his accursed old books! He needs nothing, I feel\nsure, but absolute repose of mind, sufficient sleep, a little walking,\nand that he should try to eat. To bring these things about, it requires\nthe despotic authority--yes, the despotic authority of some one who is\nnot afraid to go counter to his will--of some devoted heart not easily\nmoved or harshly immovable, or unseasonably distrustful,--some one who\nwill bear with his whims if he should have any, and with the impulsive\nexcesses of his gratitude if such should escape him,--a serious friend,\nin a word, who shall have such delicate, intelligent charity for him as\nwill make him accept and perhaps love his yoke. Well, now, Caroline, you\nare the only one here who can be that person. My brother has great\nesteem, profound respect, and, I believe, even a sincere friendship for\nyou. Try to govern him a week, a fortnight, a month perhaps, for if he\ncould get up to-day he would be here this evening turning over the\nleaves of his books and taking notes; if he sleeps again to-night he\nwill believe himself through with the whole thing, and will not go to\nbed at all the next night. You see what task we ought to impose upon\nourselves. As for my part, I am resolved upon it, entirely devoted to\nit, but by myself alone I can do nothing. I shall weary him, he will\nallow no one but me to see him, and his impatience will neutralize the\neffect of my care. With you,--a woman, a voluntary guardian, generous,\nfirm and tender, patient and resolute, as women only know how to be,--I\nwill answer for it that he will submit without ill-will, and later, when\nall the paroxysms of his disorder are passed, he will bless you for\nhaving thwarted him.\"\n\nThis insidious explanation of the case entirely dissipated the vague and\nsudden suspicion of Caroline. \"Yes, yes,\" she answered, with decision,\n\"I will be that guardian. Count upon me; I thank you for having chosen\nme, and do not think better of me on that account. I am used to nursing;\nit costs me neither effort nor fatigue. Your brother is to me, as to\nyou, so worthy of respect and so superior to every one we know that it\nis a happiness and honor to serve him. Let us, therefore, understand\neach other, so that we can share this good task without arousing\nsuspicion of any one around us here as to his real state. To begin with,\nyou install yourself in his room to-night.\"\n\n\"He will not allow that.\"\n\n\"Well, then, his breathing can be heard from here. There is a large sofa\non which one can sleep quite comfortably, muffled in a cloak. You and I\ncan pass the night here alternately, till a change is brought about.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"You must make him rise early, so that he will get the habit of sleeping\nat night; and you must bring him to breakfast with us.\"\n\n\"If you will make him promise to do these things.\"\n\n\"I will try. It is absolutely necessary that he should eat oftener than\nonce in twenty-four hours. We will make him walk or simply seat himself\nwith us in the open air till noon. That is the hour of his visit and\nyours to the Marchioness. I work with her till five o\'clock; then I\ndress--\"\n\n\"That will not take you an hour. Will you not come and pay him a short\nvisit in the library? I shall be there.\"\n\n\"Yes, so I will; we will all dine together. We will keep him in the\ndrawing-room till ten o\'clock. Then you will follow him.\"\n\n\"All this is perfect, but when my mother has visitors she will leave us\nat liberty, and you can then easily come here and talk with us an hour\nor two?\"\n\n\"No, not to talk,\" replied Caroline. \"I will come and read to him a\nlittle, for you can well imagine he will not pass all this time without\nwishing to interest himself in something, and I will read to him in a\nway to quiet him and dispose him to sleep. So, it is agreed. Only to-day\nwe shall be very much hindered by Madame d\'Arglade.\"\n\n\"To-day I take everything upon myself, and Madame d\'Arglade leaves\nto-morrow at daylight; then my brother is saved, and you are an angel!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nBeing informed by his brother of all these arrangements, the Marquis\nsubmitted with gratitude. He was extremely weak, and recovering\napparently from a dangerous crisis, which had not wholly exhausted him,\nbut had broken him down morally almost as much as a long illness would\nhave done. He could struggle against his love no longer; and having\nceased to feel the dangerous storms of passion, thanks to this\nprostration, he gave himself up to the pleasure of being tenderly cared\nfor. The Duke would not permit him to question the future. \"You cannot\ncome to any decision in your present state,\" Gaëtan would say to his\nbrother. \"You have n\'t the free use of your will: without health there\ncan be no moral clear-sightedness. Let us cure you, and then you will\nsee plainly that, with your health, you have also regained the strength\nnecessary to resist your love, or to deal with the scruples it causes.\nIn the mean time I don\'t see what you can have on your conscience, for\nMlle de Saint-Geneix suspects nothing, and after all is only doing what\na sister would do in her place.\"\n\nThis compromise quieted all the invalid\'s uneasiness. He arose and went\nto see his mother a few moments, making her believe that a slight\nindisposition was responsible for the change in his countenance. He\nasked to be excused from returning till the next day, and so for\ntwenty-four hours, that is, until after the departure of Madame\nd\'Arglade, he could give himself up to almost absolute repose.\n\nThroughout the day there subsisted between the Duke and Caroline an air\nof mutual intelligence and an exchange of glances which had for their\nsubject only the Marquis and his health, but which completely deluded\nLéonie. She went away perfectly sure of her facts, but without saying\nanything to the Marchioness which could lead that old lady to suppose\nher possessed of any penetration whatever.\n\nAt the close of the week M. de Villemer was much better. Every symptom\nof aneurism had passed away, and under rational treatment he even\nregained a certain glow of health, as well as a mental serenity, to\nwhich he had long been a stranger. No one for ten years had taken care\nof him with the assiduity, the devotedness, the evenness of temper, the\nunheard-of charm, with which Mlle de Saint-Geneix contrived to surround\nhim: we might even say he had never met with attentions at once so\nsensible and so tender, for his mother, aside from her lack of active\nphysical strength, had shown herself excitable and over-anxious in the\ncare she had lavished on him when his life had before been threatened.\nShe had, indeed, at this time some suspicion of a relapse, when she saw\nher son more frequently with her, and consequently less devoted to his\nwork; but when this idea occurred the crisis had already passed: the\ngood understanding between the Duke and Caroline as to the need of\ntranquillity, the absolute ignorance of the servants, few in numbers and\ntherefore very busy, and the serenity of the Marquis himself, all tended\nto reassure her; and at the close of a fortnight she even observed that\nher son was regaining an air of youth and health at which she could but\nrejoice.\n\nThe condition of the Marquis had been carefully concealed from Madame\nd\'Arglade. The Duke would in no wise give up the great marriage\nprojected for his brother. He thought Léonie was a foolish chatterbox,\nand did not care to have it understood in society that his brother\'s\nhealth, at any moment, might give serious cause for alarm. The Duke had\nthoroughly warned Caroline on this point. He was playing with her, in\nthe interests of his brother as he understood them, the double game of\npreparing her as far as possible, and little by little, for the exercise\nof an unlimited devotion; and to this end, he thought best to remind\nher, now and then, that the future well-being of the family rested\nentirely on the famous marriage. Caroline, then, had no chance to forget\nthis; and relying on the integrity of the two brothers, on her own ideas\nof duty and the unselfishness of her heart, she walked resolutely toward\nan abyss which might have engulfed her. And thus the Duke, naturally\nkind, and animated by the best intentions toward his brother, was coolly\nworking out the misery of a poor girl whose personal merit made her\nworthy of the highest places of happiness and consideration.\n\nFortunately for Mlle de Saint-Geneix, although the conscience of the\nMarquis was somewhat stupefied, it was not wholly asleep. Besides, his\npassion was made up of enthusiasm and sincere affection. He insisted\nthat the Duke should be with them almost always, and in his abrupt\nsincerity he came near releasing Caroline from her attendance\naltogether, promising not to begin work again without her permission.\nThe moment came even when he did give her this promise to induce her to\ncease her watch in the library; he had found her there more than once, a\nguardian, gently and gayly \"savage,\" over the books and portfolios,\nplaced, she said, under interdict till further orders; but the Duke\ncounteracted the effect of this \"imprudence\" on his brother\'s part, by\ntelling Caroline, in a very low voice, that she must not trust a\npromise, given in good faith to be sure, but which Urbain would not have\nit in his power to keep. \"You don\'t know how absent-minded he is,\" said\nthe Duke; \"when an idea takes hold of him it masters him, and makes him\nforget all his promises. I have found him myself, more than twenty\ntimes, searching over these bookshelves while my back was turned, and\nwhen I called out, \'Here, here, you marauder!\' he seemed startled out of\na revery and looked at me with an air of great surprise.\"\n\nSo Caroline did not relax her watchfulness. The library was much farther\nfrom her room than from that of the Marquis; but yet so near the centre\nof the house that the constant presence of the young lady reader in this\nroom devoted to study was not likely to strike the servants as anything\nremarkable. They saw her there often, sometimes alone, sometimes with\nthe Duke or the Marquis, more frequently with both, although the Duke\nhad a thousand pretexts for leaving her alone with his brother; but even\nthen the doors always open, the book often in Caroline\'s hands, the\nevident interest with which she was reading, and lastly, more than all\nthis, the real truth of the situation,--truth, which has more power than\nthe best-planned deception,--removed every pretext and even every desire\nfor malicious comment.\n\nIn this state of things Caroline was really happy, and often recurred to\nit in after years as the most delightful phase of her life. She had\nsuffered from Urbain\'s coldness, but now she found him showing an\nunhoped-for kindness and a disposition to trust her again. As soon as\nall fears for his health were dispelled, a bond was established between\nthem, which, for Caroline, had not a single doubt or apprehension. The\nMarquis enjoyed her reading exceedingly, and before long he even\nconsented to let her help him with his work. She conducted\ninvestigations for him and took notes, which she classified in the very\nspirit he desired,--a spirit she seemed to divine wonderfully. In short,\nshe rendered his studies so pleasant, and relieved him so cleverly from\nthe dry and disagreeable portions, that he could once more betake\nhimself to writing without pain or fatigue.\n\nThe Marquis certainly needed a secretary far more than his mother did;\nbut he had never been able to endure this interposition between himself\nand the objects of his researches. He saw very soon, however, that\nCaroline never led him off into ideas foreign to his own, but kept him\nfrom straying away himself into useless speculations and reveries. She\nhad a remarkable clearness of judgment, joined with a faculty rarely\npossessed by women, namely, that of order in the sequence of thought.\nShe could remain absorbed in any pursuit a long while, without fatigue\nor faltering. The Marquis made a discovery,--one that was destined to\ndirect his future. He found himself in presence of a superior mind, not\ncreative, indeed, but analytic in the highest degree,--just the\norganization he needed to give balance and scope to his own intellect.\n\nLet us say, once for all, that M. de Villemer was a man of very sound\nunderstanding; but he had not found as yet, and was still awaiting, the\ncrisis of its development. Hence the slow and painful progress of his\nwork. He thought and wrote rapidly; but his conscientiousness, as a\nphilosopher and moralist, was always putting fresh obstacles in the way\nof his enthusiasm as an historian. He was the victim of his own\nscruples, like certain devotees, sincere but morbid, who always imagine\nthey have failed to tell their confessor the whole truth. He wanted to\nconfess to the human race the truth about social science; and did not\nsufficiently admit that this science of truths and facts is, largely, a\nrelative one, determined by the age in which one lives. He could not\ndecide on his course. He strove to discover the meaning of facts long\nburied among the arcana of the past, and after he had, with great labor,\ncaught a few traces of these, he was surprised to find them often\ncontradictory, and in alarm would doubt his own discernment or his own\nimpartiality, would suspend judgment, laying aside his work, and for\nweeks and months would be the prey of terrible uncertainties and\nmisgivings.\n\nCaroline, without knowing his book, which was still only half written,\nand which he concealed with a morbid timidity, soon divined the cause of\nhis mental uneasiness from his conversation, and especially his remarks\nwhile she was reading aloud. She volunteered a few off-hand reflections\nof extreme simplicity, but so plainly just and right as to be\nunanswerable. She was not perplexed by a little blot on a grand life or\na tiny glimmer of reason in an age of delirium. She thought the past\nmust be viewed just as we look at paintings, from the distance required\nby the eye of each in order to take in the whole; and that, as the great\nmasters have done in composing their pictures, we must learn to\nsacrifice the petty details, which sometimes really destroy the harmony\nof nature, and even her logic. She called attention to the fact that we\nnotice on a landscape, at every step, strange effects of light and\nshade, and the multitude will say, \"How could a painter render that?\"\nand the painter would reply, \"By not rendering it at all.\"\n\nShe admitted that the historian is fettered more than the artist to\naccuracy in matters of fact, but she denied that there could be progress\non any different principles in either case. The past and even the\npresent of individual or collective life, according to her, take color\nand meaning only from their general tenor and results.\n\nShe ventured on these suggestions, cautiously putting them in the form\nof questions; without being positive, and as if willing to suppress them\nin case they were not approved; but M. de Villemer was struck with them,\nbecause he felt she had given expression to a certainty, an inward\nfaith, and that if she consented to keep silence, she would still remain\nnone the less convinced. He struggled a little, nevertheless, laying\nbefore her a number of facts which had delayed and troubled him. She\npassed judgment on them in one word, with the strong, good sense of a\nfresh mind and a pure heart, and he soon exclaimed with a glance at the\nDuke, \"She finds the truth because she has it within her, and that is\nthe first condition of clear insight. Never will the troubled\nconscience, never will the perverted mind, comprehend history.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said she, \"that is why history should not be too much made up\nfrom memoirs, for these are nearly always the work of prejudice or\npassions of the moment. It is the fashion now to dig these out with\ngreat care, bringing forward many trifling facts not generally known,\nand which do not deserve to be known.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" replied the Marquis; \"if the historian, instead of\nstanding firm in his belief and worship of lofty things, lets himself be\nmisled and distracted by trivial ones, truth loses all that reality\nusurps.\"\n\nIf we relate these bits of conversation, perhaps a little out of the\nusual color of a romance, it is because they are necessary to explain\nthe seriousness and apparent calmness of the relations that were growing\nup between the scholar and the humble lady-reader in the castle of\nSéval, in spite of the pains the Duke was taking to leave them as much\nas possible to the tender influences of youth and love. The Marquis felt\nthat he belonged to Caroline, not only through his enthusiasm, his\ndreams, his need of throwing a kind of ideal about grace and beauty, but\nthrough his reason, his judgment, and through his present certainty that\nhe had met that ideal. Henceforth Caroline was safe; she commanded\nrespect by the weight of her character, and the Marquis stood in no\nfurther fear of losing control of his own impulses.\n\nThe Duke was at first astonished by this unlooked-for result of their\nintimacy. His brother was cured, he was happy, he seemed to have\nconquered love by the very power of love itself; but the Duke was\nintelligent and he understood. He was even seized himself with a serious\ndeference for Caroline. He took an interest in her reading, and soon,\ninstead of falling asleep under the first few pages, he wanted to read\nin his turn and give them his impressions. He had no convictions, but,\nin the artist spirit, allowed himself to be moved and borne along by\nthose of others. He had read but little on serious subjects, in the\ncourse of his life, but he had admirably retained all kinds of dates and\nproper names. So that he had in his fine memory, as one might say, a\nsort of network with large meshes to which the loose lines of his\nbrother\'s studies could be tied. That is, he was a stranger to nothing\nexcept the logical and profound meanings of historical events. He did\nnot lack prejudices; but excellence of style had a power over him which\nput them to silence, and before an eloquent page, whether of Bossuet or\nRousseau, he felt the same enthusiasm.\n\nThus he also found himself pleasantly initiated into the pursuits of the\nMarquis and the society of Mlle de Saint-Geneix. What was really very\ngood in him is that, from the day he first became aware of his brother\'s\naffection for Caroline, she ceased to be a woman in his eyes. He had\nnevertheless felt some emotion for several days in her presence, and the\ntruth had come upon him unexpectedly in an hour of feverish spite. From\nday to day he abjured every evil thought, and, touched by seeing that\nthe Marquis, after a terrible attack of jealousy, had restored to him\nhis entire confidence, he knew, for the first time in his life, what it\nwas to feel a true and worthy friendship for a pretty woman.\n\nIn the month of July Caroline wrote to her sister thus:--\n\n\"Be easy about me, dear Camille, it is some time since I ceased to watch\nthe invalid, for the invalid has never before been so well; but I have\nalways kept up the practice of rising at day-break in the summer season,\nand every morning I have several hours I can devote to the work he is\nkindly permitting me to share with him. Just now he is himself sleeping\na good sound sleep, for he retires at ten o\'clock, and I am allowed here\nto do the same, and I often have precious intervals of freedom even in\nthe daytime. Our proximity to the baths of Évaux and the road to Vichy\nbrings us visitors at the very hours when in Paris the Marchioness used\nto shut herself up; she says this disturbs and wearies her, and yet, all\nthe while, she is delighted! The great correspondence suffers under it,\nbut even the correspondence itself has diminished, since the marriage of\nthe Marquis was projected. This scheme so absorbs Madame de Villemer,\nthat she cannot help confiding it or hinting something about it to all\nher old friends; after which she will reflect seriously, admitting the\nimprudence of saying much about it, and that she ought not to rely on\nthe discretion of so many people; and then we throw into the fire the\nletters she has just dictated. This it is that leads her to say so\noften: \'Bah! let us stop writing, I would rather say nothing at all than\nnot to mention things that interest me.\'\n\n\"When she has visitors she makes a sign that I may go and join the\nMarquis, for she knows now that I am taking notes for him. Since his\nillness is over, I thought there ought to be no mystery made about so\nsimple a thing, and she is quite willing to have me relieve her son from\nany wearisome portions of his work. She is very curious to know what\nthis book so carefully concealed can possibly be; but there is no\ndanger, of my betraying anything, for I don\'t know a single word in it.\nI only know that just now we are deep in the history of France, and more\nespecially in the age of Richelieu; but what I need not mention to any\none here is, that I anticipate a great divergence in opinion between the\nson and the mother on a host of grave matters.\n\n\"Do not blame me for having taken on myself a double task, and for\nhaving gained, as you put it, two masters in the place of one. With the\nMarchioness the task is sacred, and I have an affectionate pleasure in\nit; with her son the task is agreeable, and I put into it that kind of\nveneration of which I have often told you. I enjoy the idea of having\ncontributed to his recovery, of having managed to take care of him\nwithout making him impatient, of having gently persuaded him to live a\nlittle more as people ought to live in order to be well. I have even\ntaken advantage of his passion for study by telling him that his genius\nwill feel the effects of disease, and that I have no faith in the\nintellectual clearness of fever. You have no idea how good he has been\nto me, how patiently he has taken rebuke, and how he has even let\nhimself be scolded by this young-lady sister of yours; how he has\nthanked me for my interest in him, and submitted to all my\nprescriptions. It has gone so far that at table, even, he consults me\nwith his eyes as to what he shall eat, and when we go out for a walk he\nhas no more mind of his own than a child as to the little journey which\nthe Duke and I insist on making him take. He has a charming disposition,\nand every day I discover some new trait in his character. I did think he\nwas a little whimsical and decidedly obstinate; but, poor fellow! it was\nthe crisis that was threatening his life. He has, on the contrary, a\ngentleness and evenness of temper which is beyond everything; and the\ncharm of familiar intercourse with him resembles nothing so much as the\nbeauty, of the waters flowing through our valley, always limpid, always\nplentiful, borne along in a strong and even current, never ruffled or\ncapricious. And to follow out this comparison, I might say that his mind\nhas also flowery banks and oases of verdure where one can pause and\ndream delightfully, for he is full of poetry; and I always wonder how he\nhas ever subjected the warmth of his imagination to the rigid demands of\nhistory.\n\n\"What is more, he pretends that all this is a discovery of mine, and\nthat he is just beginning to perceive it himself. The other day we were\nlooking at the beautiful pastures full of sheep and goats in a ravine\ncrossing that of the Char. At the farther end of this sharp cut, there\nis a casing of rugged rocks, and some of their notches rise so far above\nthe plateau that, in comparison with the lower level, it is really a\nmountain; and these beautiful rocks of lilac-gray form a crest,\nsufficiently imposing to conceal the flat country that lies behind, so\nyou cannot see from here the upper part of the plateau, and you might\nimagine yourself in some nook of Switzerland. At least, this is what M.\nde Villemer tells me, to console me for the way in which the Marchioness\nscouts my admiration. \'Don\'t worry about that,\' said he, \'and don\'t\nthink it necessary to have seen many sublime things in order to have the\nconception and the sensation of sublimity. There is grandeur everywhere\nfor those who carry this faculty within themselves; it is not an\nillusion which they cherish either; it is a revelation of what really\nexists in nature in a manner more or less pronounced. For dull senses,\nthere must be coarse signs of the power and dimensions of things. This\nis why many people who go to Scotland, looking for the pictures\ndescribed by Walter Scott, cannot find them, and pretend that the poet\nhas overpraised his country. His pictures are there, nevertheless, I am\nvery sure, and if you should go there, you would find them at once.\'\n\n\"I confessed to him that real immensity tempted me greatly; that I often\nsaw, in dreams, inaccessible mountains and giddy abysses; that, before\nan engraving representing the furious waterfalls in Sweden or the bergs\nthat stray from Arctic seas, I have been carried away with wild\nimaginations of independence, and that there is no tale of distant\nexplorations with enough of suffering and danger in it to take away my\nregret at not having shared them.\n\n\"\'And yet,\' said he, \'before a charming little landscape like this you\nseemed happy and really satisfied a moment ago. Do you then really feel\nmore in need of emotions and surprises than of tenderness and safety?\nSee how beautiful it is, this stillness! How this hour of reflected\nlights, barred across with lengthening shadows, this water, in spray\nwhich seems caressing the sides of the rock, this motionless leafage\nlooking as if it were silently drinking in the gold of the last\nsunbeams, how truly indeed is all this serene and thoughtful solemnity\nthe expression of the beautiful and good in nature! I never used to know\nall this myself. It has not impressed me strongly until lately. I have\nalways been living in the midst of dust and death, or among\nabstractions. I used, indeed, to dream over the pictures of history, the\nphantasmagoria of the past. I have sometimes seen the fleet of Cleopatra\nsailing to the verge of the horizon; in the silence of the night I have\nthought I heard the warlike trumpets of Roncesvalles; but it was the\ndominion of a dream, and the reality did not speak to me. But when I saw\nyou gazing at the horizon without saying a word, with an air of content\nthat was like nothing else in the world, I asked myself what could be\nthe secret of your joy; and, if I must tell you all, your selfish\npatient was a little jealous of everything that charmed you. He set\nhimself perturbedly to work at gazing too, when he settled the point at\nonce; for he felt that he loved what you loved.\'\n\n\"You understand perfectly, my dear little sister, that in talking to me\nthus the Marquis told an audacious falsehood, for one can but see from\nall his remarks, and his manner of making them, that he has the true\nartist enthusiasm for nature, as well as for all else that is lovely;\nbut he is so grateful to me, and so full of honest kindliness, that he\nmisrepresents things in perfect good faith, and imagines himself\nindebted to me for something new in his intellectual life.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nOne morning the Marquis, writing at the large table in the library,\nwhile Caroline at the other end was turning over some maps, laid down\nhis pen and said to her with emotion,--\n\n\"Mlle de Saint-Geneix, I remember that you have sometimes expressed a\ngood-natured wish to know about this work of mine, and I thought I could\nnever make up my mind to satisfy you; but now,--yes, now, I feel that\nsubmitting it to you will give me pleasure. This book is your work much\nmore than it is mine, after all; because I did not believe in it, and\nyou have led me to respect the impulse which prompted it. By restoring\nmy faith in my task, you have enabled me to carry it further in one\nmonth than I had done for ten years before. You are also the cause why I\nshall certainly finish a thing which I should, perhaps, have been always\nrecommencing until my last hour. Besides, it was near at hand, this last\nhour! I felt it coming quickly, and I hastened, the prey of despair, for\nI could see nothing advancing but the close of my life. You ordered me\nto live, and I have lived; to be calm, and I am at peace; to believe in\nGod, and in myself, and I do so believe. Since I now have faith in my\nthought you must also give me faith in my power to express it, for\nalthough I do not hold to style more than is reasonable, yet I consider\nit necessary to give weight and attractiveness to truth. Here, my\nfriend, read!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Caroline, eagerly; \"you see that I do not hesitate, that\nI do not refuse; and this is neither prudent nor modest on my part. Very\nwell, I am not disturbed by that! I am so sure of your talent, that I\nstand in no fear of the fact that I shall have to be sincere, and I\nbelieve so thoroughly in the harmony of our opinions, that I even\nflatter myself I shall comprehend what, under other circumstances, would\nbe beyond my reach.\"\n\nBut, as she was about to take the manuscript, Caroline hesitated before\naccepting so especial a mark of confidence, and inquired whether the\nexcellent Duke was not also to be a sharer in this gratification.\n\n\"No,\" replied the Marquis, \"my brother will not come to-day. I have\nseized upon a time when he is away hunting. I do not wish him to know\nabout my work before it is finished; he would not comprehend it. His\nhereditary prejudices would stand in the way. To be sure he thinks he\nhas a few \'advanced ideas\' as he calls them, and he knows that I go\nfarther than he; but he does not suspect how far I have strayed from the\nroad in which my education placed me. My rebellion against these things\nof the past would put him in consternation, and this might disturb me\nbefore the close of my work. But you yourself,--perhaps you are going to\nbe a little uneasy?\"\n\n\"I have reached no decision myself,\" replied Caroline, \"and very\nprobably I shall adopt your opinions when I understand them exactly. Sit\ndown now; I will read aloud for your benefit as well as my own. I want\nyou to hear yourself speak. I think this must be a good way of rereading\none\'s work.\"\n\nCaroline read that morning a half-volume, resuming the employment the\nnext day and the day after. In three days, she had made the Marquis\nlisten to a summary of his studies for many years. She followed his\nhandwriting as easily as print, although it was somewhat blind; and as\nshe read aloud with admirable clearness, intelligence, and simplicity,\ngrowing animated and conscious of her own emotion when the narration\nrose to the lyric passages in the epic construction of the history, the\nauthor felt himself enlightened at once by a very sun of certainty\nformed of all the scattered rays by which his meditations had been\npenetrated.\n\nThe picture was fine, of beautiful originality, bearing the stamp of\nreal greatness. Under the simple and mysterious heading, \"The History of\nTitles,\" he raised a whole series of bold questions, which aimed at\nnothing less than rendering universal, without restrictions and forever,\nthe thought of the revolutionary night, August 4, 1789. This son of a\nnoble house with ancient privileges, brought up in the pride of family\nand in the disdain of commoners, introduced before our modern\ncivilization a written accusation of the nobility, along with documents\nto sustain his case, the proofs of their usurpations, their outrages, or\ntheir crimes, and pronounced sentence of forfeiture against them in the\nname of logic and justice, in the name of the human conscience, and,\nmore than all, in the name of simple, scriptural Christianity. He boldly\nattacked the compromise of eighteen centuries, which would ally the\nequality revealed by the apostles to the arrangements of civil and\ntheocratical hierarchies. Admitting in all classes none but political\nand executive hierarchies, that is to say, official positions, held as\nproofs of personal courage and social activity, or in a word, of any\nreal services rendered, he pursued the privilege of birth as far as into\nthe present state of public opinion and even as far as its final\ninfluences; tracing with a firm hand the history of the spoliations and\nusurpations of power from the creation of the feudal nobility down to\nthe present time. It was reconstructing the history of France from a\nspecial point of view, under the sway of one idea,--a distinct,\nabsolute, inflexible, indignant idea, springing from that religious\nfeeling, which aristocracy cannot attack, without itself committing\nsuicide, invoking, as it does, the divine right for the support of its\nown institution.\n\nWe will say no more about the data of this book, even a criticism of\nwhich would be foreign to our subject. Whatever judgment might be passed\non the convictions of the author, it was impossible not to recognize in\nhim a splendid talent, joined to the knowledge and strong good faith\nwhich mark a mind of the first rank. His style especially was\nmagnificent, of a copiousness and richness which the modest brevity of\nthe Marquis in social life would never have led one to suspect; though,\neven in his book, he gave small space to discussions. After having\nstated his premises and the motives of his investigation in a few pages\nof warm and severe criticism, he passed on with eloquent clearness to\nthe facts themselves and classified them historically. His narrations,\nteeming as they did with color, had the interest of a drama or a\nromance, even when, rummaging among obscure family archives, he revealed\nthe horrors of feudal times, with the sufferings and degradation of the\nlower classes. An enthusiast, but making no apologies for the fact, he\ndeeply felt all offences against justice, against modesty, against love,\nand in many pages his soul, in its passion for truth, justice, and\nbeauty, would reveal itself entirely in bursts of excited eloquence.\nMore than once Caroline felt the tears come to her eyes, and laid aside\nthe book to recover her composure.\n\nCaroline made no objections. It is not for the simple narrator to say\nthat she should have made them or that there were really none to make;\nit is necessary to relate merely that she found no objections to offer;\nso great was her admiration of his ability and her esteem for the man\nhimself. The Marquis de Villemer became in her eyes a person so\ncompletely superior to all she had ever met, that she then and there\nformed the purpose of devoting herself to him unreservedly and for her\nwhole life.\n\nWhen we say \"unreservedly\" we are mindful that there was very certainly\none exception which would not have been agreed to thus, had it presented\nitself to her mind; but it did not present itself. In such a man there\nwas nothing to disturb the serenity of her enthusiasm. And yet we should\nnot dare to affirm that, from this time onward, her enthusiasm did not\nunconsciously include love as one of the elements indispensable to its\nfulness; but love had not been its point of departure. The Marquis had\nnever until now revealed all the attractiveness of his intellect or of\nhis person; he had been constrained, agitated, and out of health.\nCaroline did not, at first, perceive the change in him, that was taking\nplace in such a gradual way, for he grew eloquent, young, and handsome,\nday by day, and hour by hour; recovering his health, his confidence in\nhimself, the certainty of his own power, and the charm happiness gives\nto a noble face which has been veiled by doubt.\n\nWhen she began to account for all these delightful transformations, she\nhad already felt their effects without her own knowledge, and the autumn\nhad come. They were about returning to Paris, and Madame de Villemer,\nunder the sway of a fixed idea, would say every day to her young\ncompanion, \"In three weeks, in a fortnight, in a week, the \'famous\'\ninterview of my son with Mlle de Xaintrailles will take place.\"\n\nCaroline then felt a fearful anguish in the depths of her heart, a\nconsternation, a terror, and an overmastering revelation of a kind of\nattachment which she did not yet confess even to herself. She had so\nfully accepted the vague and still distant prospect of this marriage\nthat she had never been willing to ask herself whether it would give her\npain. It was for her a thing inevitable, like old age or death; but one\ndoes not really accept, old age or death until either arrives, and\nCaroline felt that she was growing weak and that she should die at the\nthought of this absolute separation, so near at hand.\n\nShe had ended by believing with the Marchioness that the scheme could\nnot fail. She had never dared to question the Marquis; besides the Duke\nhad forbidden this, in the name of the friendship she felt for the\nfamily. According to him, the Marquis would never come to a decision as\nlong as he was tormented about it, and the Duke well knew that the least\nanxiety on Caroline\'s part would overthrow all his brother\'s designs.\n\nThe Duke, after having sincerely admired the purity of their relations,\nbegan to grow anxious about it. \"This is becoming,\" said he to himself\n\"an attachment so serious that one cannot foresee its results. Shall we\nbelieve that his tender respect for her has killed his love? No, no,\nsuch respect in a case like this is love with redoubled power.\"\n\nThe Duke was not mistaken. The Marquis was not at all concerned at the\nprospect of a marriage which he had now determined not to contract. He\nwas only troubled about the change which a residence in Paris would for\na time effect in his relations with Mlle de Saint-Geneix, in their free\nintimacy, in their common studies, in that continuous security which\ncould not be found elsewhere. He mentioned this to her with great\nsadness. She felt the same regret, and attributed her own inward sorrow\nto her love for the country and to the breaking up of a life so sweet\nand noble.\n\nShe, however, experienced a charming surprise on her arrival in Paris.\nShe found her sister there awaiting her with the children, and learned\nthat Camille was going to be near her. She was to live at Étampes in a\nlittle house, half city and half country residence, pretty, new, in a\ngood atmosphere, with the enjoyment besides of a considerable garden.\nShe would be only an hour\'s ride by rail from Paris. She had placed Lili\nat school, having obtained a scholarship for her in a Parisian convent.\nCaroline would be able to see her every week. Finally a scholarship had\nalso been promised her for little Charles, in a college when he should\nbe old enough to enter.\n\n\"You fill me with surprise and delight!\" cried Caroline, embracing her\nsister; \"but who has worked all these miracles?\"\n\n\"You,\" replied Camille, \"you alone; it is always you.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I had hopes of obtaining these scholarships, that is, of\nprocuring them some day or other, through Léonie, who is so obliging;\nbut I did not hope for such prompt success.\"\n\n\"O no!\" replied Madame Heudebert, \"this did not come from Léonie; it\ncame from some one here.\"\n\n\"Impossible! I have never said a word about it to the Marchioness.\nKnowing how much she is at variance with \'the powers that be,\' I should\nnot have dared--\"\n\n\"Some one has dared to approach the ministry, and this some one--he does\nnot wish to be named; he has acted in secrecy, and yet I shall betray\nhim because it is impossible for me to keep a secret from you--this some\none is the Marquis de Villemer.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then you wrote to ask him--\"\n\n\"Not at all. It was he who wrote to me, inquiring about my situation and\nmy claims with a kindness, a propriety, a delicacy,--yes, Caroline, you\nwere quite right in esteeming a character like his. But stop, I have\nbrought his letters. I wish you would read them.\" Caroline read the\nletters, and saw that, beginning from the day when she had taken care of\nM. de Villemer, he had been bestowing attentions upon her family, with\na lively and constant interest. He had anticipated her secret wishes, he\nhad concerned himself about the education of the children. He had taken\nprompt and sure measures by letter, without even offering to take them;\nconfining himself to asking Camille for the necessary information as to\nthe services of her husband in his department. He had announced his\nsuccess, refusing to be thanked, and saying that his debt of gratitude\nto Mlle de Saint-Geneix was far from being paid. This good news had\nreached Camille during the slow journey with post-horses which Caroline\nwas taking with the Marchioness, for the old lady had a fear and horror\nof coaches and railways.\n\nAs to the house at Étampes, this was also the idea and proposition of\nthe Marquis. There was, he said, a little estate, bringing in nothing,\nwhich had been left him by an aged relative, and he begged Madame\nHeudebert to do him the favor of living there. She had accepted this\noffer, saying that she would take upon herself all the expense of\nrepairs; but she had found the little house in excellent condition,\nfurnished, and even provided with fuel, wine, and vegetables for more\nthan a year. When she inquired about the rent of the person charged by\nthe Marquis with these details, he replied that his orders were to\nreceive no money, that it was too slight a matter, and that the Marquis\nhad never proposed to rent the house of his aged cousin to strangers.\n\nThough Caroline was deeply moved by these favors from her friend, and\npleased to see the lot of her family so much improved, she felt,\nnevertheless, a sorrow at heart. It seemed as if this was a kind of\nfarewell from him whose life was to be parted forever from her own, and,\nas it were, an account settled by his gratitude. She drove back this\nsorrow, however, and passed her mornings for several days in walking out\nwith her sister and the children, in buying the outfit of the little\nschool-girl, and finally in establishing her at the convent. The\nMarchioness wished to see Madame Heudebert, and the pretty Elizabeth who\nwas going to lose at the convent her soft pet name of Lili. She was\npleasant to Caroline\'s sister, and did not let the child depart without\na pretty present: she wished to give Caroline two days of freedom with\nher family, so that she might have ample time to bid them good by and\nconduct them to the station again. She even rode herself to the convent\nto recommend Elizabeth Heudebert as under her special protection.\n\nCamille had also seen the Marquis and the Duke at their mother\'s; she\nhad only ventured to present Lili to her benefactor, the other children\nnot being old enough; but M. de Villemer wanted to see them all; he went\nto call upon Madame Heudebert at the hotel where she had taken lodgings,\nand found Caroline in the midst of the children, by whom she was almost\nworshipped. She found him, for his part, not in a revery, but apparently\nabsorbed in the contemplation of the cares and caresses that she gave\nthem. He looked at each child with tender attention, and spoke to them\nall, like a man in whom the paternal sentiment is already well\ndeveloped. Caroline, ignorant that he really was a father, imagined,\nwith a sigh, that he was thinking of future family joys.\n\nThe following day, after she had seen her sister safely in the railway\ncarriage which was to carry her back to Étampes, Caroline felt herself\nhorribly alone, and, for the first time, the marriage of the Marquis\npresented itself to her mind as an irreparable disaster in her own life.\nShe left the platform quickly to hide her tears; but in the court she\ncame directly upon M. de Villemer. \"What!\" said he, offering her his\narm. \"You are weeping. That is just what I was expecting; and I was\nanxious to come to this place, where pretexts for the public are not\nwanting, to sustain you a little in this sorrow which is so natural, and\nto remind you that you still have sincere friends here.\"\n\n\"What! did you come here on my account?\" replied Caroline, wiping away\nher tears. \"I am ashamed of this momentary weakness. It is ingratitude\nto you who have loaded my relatives with favors, who have established\nthem near me, and whom I ought to bless with joy instead of feeling the\nslight pain of a separation which cannot last very long. My sister will\noften return to see her daughter, and I shall see her myself oftener\nstill. No, no, I have no cause for grief; on the contrary, I am very\nhappy,--thanks to you for it!\"\n\n\"Then why do you still weep?\" said the Marquis, as he led her back to\nthe carriage he had brought for her: \"come, you are a little nervous,\nare you not? but it troubles me. Let us go back to the platform as if we\nwere in search of some one. I shall not leave you in tears. It is the\nfirst time I have seen you weeping, and it hurts me. Stop, we are only a\nfew steps from the Jardin des Plantes; at eight in the morning there is\nno risk of meeting any one we know. Besides, with that mantle and veil,\nno one will recognize you. It is pleasant enough; will you come and look\nat the \'Swiss Valley\'? We will try to imagine ourselves in the country\nagain, and when I leave you, I shall be sure--at least, I hope, that you\nwill not be ill.\"\n\nThere was so much friendly solicitude in the tone of the Marquis, that\nCaroline did not think of refusing his offer. \"Who knows,\" thought she,\n\"that he does not wish to bid me a brotherly adieu before entering upon\nhis new existence? It is, indeed, a thing which is allowable for us to\ndo,--which perhaps we ought to do. He has never yet spoken to me of his\nmarriage; it would be strange if he did not speak to me about it, and if\nI were not prepared and willing to hear him.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nThe Marquis made a sign for the coachman to follow them, and conducted\nCaroline on foot, chatting pleasantly with her about her sister and the\nchildren; but, neither during this short walk, nor on the shaded avenues\nof the \"Swiss Valley\" in the Jardin des Plantes, did he say one word\nabout himself. It was only when he stopped with her under the pendent\nboughs of Jussieu\'s cedar, just as they were on the point of returning,\nthat he said, smiling, and in the most indifferent tone, \"Do you know\nthat my official presentation to Mlle de Xaintrailles takes place\nto-day?\"\n\nIt seemed to the Marquis that he felt Caroline\'s arm trembling as it\nrested on his own; but she replied, with sincerity and resolution, \"No,\nI did not know that it was to-day.\"\n\n\"If I speak to you at all about this,\" he resumed, \"it is only because I\nknow my mother and my brother have kept you informed of this fine\nproject. I have never talked with you about it myself; it was not worth\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Then you thought that I would not be interested in your happiness?\"\n\n\"My happiness! How can it be in the hands of a lady I do not know? And\nyou, my friend, how can you speak so,--you who know me?\"\n\n\"Then I will say the happiness of your mother,--since that depends upon\nthis marriage.\"\n\n\"O, that is another matter,\" replied M. de Villemer, quickly. \"Shall we\nrest a moment on this seat, and while we are alone here will you let me\ntalk a little about my position?\"\n\nThey seated themselves. \"You will not be cold?\" continued the Marquis,\nwrapping the folds of Caroline\'s mantle around her.\n\n\"No, and you?\"\n\n\"O, as for me, my health is robust now, thanks to you, and that is why\nthey think seriously of making me the head of a family of my own. It is\na happiness which I do not need so much as they suppose. There are\nalready children in the world that one loves,--just as you love those of\nyour sister! But let us pass that over and suppose that I really dream\nof descendants in a long line. You understand that I do not hold to this\nas a point of family pride; you know my ideas about nobility; they are\nnot precisely those of the people around me. Unfortunately for the\npeople around me, I cannot change in this regard; it no longer depends\nupon myself.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" replied Mlle de Saint-Geneix, \"but your heart is too\ncomprehensive not to long after the warmest and holiest affections of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Suppose all that you please in that respect,\" replied the Marquis, \"and\nthen understand that the choice of the mother of my children is the most\nimportant affair of my life. Well, then, this great transaction, this\nsacred choice, do you think any one else could attend to it in my place?\nDo you admit that even my excellent mother can wake up some morning and\nsay, \'There is in society a young lady, whose name is illustrious and\nwhose fortune is large, and who is to be the wife of my son, because my\nfriends and I consider the match advantageous and proper? My son does\nnot know her, but no matter! Perhaps she will not please him at all;\nperhaps he will displease her as much; no matter again! It would please\nmy eldest son, my friend the duchess, and all those who frequent my\nlittle drawing-room. My son must be unnatural if he does not sacrifice\nhis repugnance to this fancy. And if Mlle de Xaintrailles should think\nof such a thing as not calling him perfect, she will be no longer worthy\nof the name she bears!\' You see plainly, my friend, that all this is\nabsurd, and I am astonished that you have taken it seriously for one\nmoment.\"\n\nCaroline struggled in vain against the inexpressible joy which this\nassurance caused her; but she quickly remembered all the Duke had said,\nand all that duty required her to say herself.\n\n\"You astonish me too,\" rejoined she. \"Did you not promise your mother\nand your brother to see Mlle de Xaintrailles at the appointed time?\"\n\n\"And so I shall see her this evening; it is an interview arranged in\nsuch a way as to appear accidental, and one which does not bind me in\nany respect.\"\n\n\"That is an evasion which I cannot admit in a conscience like that of\nthe Marquis de Villemer. You have passed your word that you will do your\nbest toward recognizing the merit of this person, and making her\nappreciate yours.\"\n\n\"O, I ask nothing better than to do my best in that direction,\" replied\nthe Marquis, with so merry and winning a laugh that Caroline was dazzled\nby the look he fixed upon her.\n\n\"Then you are making light of your mother\'s wishes?\" resumed she, arming\nherself with all her reserve of resistance; \"I never would have believed\nyou capable of that.\"\n\n\"No, no, I am not, indeed,\" replied M. de Villemer, recovering his\nseriousness. \"When they exacted this promise from me I did not laugh, I\nassure you. I was in deep sorrow and seriously ill; I felt myself dying,\nand I thought my heart was already dead. I yielded to tender and cruel\npersuasions, in the hope that they would let me die in peace; but I have\nbeen recalled, my friend; I have taken a new lease of life; I feel\nmyself full of youth again, and of the future. Love is astir within me,\nlike the sap in this great tree; yes, love,--that is, faith, strength, a\nsense of my immortal being, which I must account for to God, and not to\nhuman prejudice. I will be happy in my own way; I will live, and I will\nnot marry unless I can love with my whole soul!\n\n\"Do not tell me,\" continued he, without giving Caroline time to reply,\n\"that I have other duties in opposition to this. I am not a weak,\nirresolute man. I am not satisfied with words consecrated by usage, and\nI do not propose to become the slave and the victim of ambitious\nchimeras. My mother desires to recover our wealth! She is at fault in\nthat. Her true happiness and her true glory are in having renounced it\nall to save her eldest son. She is richer now--since I have arranged for\nher support at the price of nearly all I have left--than she was ten\nyears ago, submitting with terror to a doubtful situation, and one which\nshe believed must grow worse. See, then, if I have not done for her all\nthat I could do! I have certain strong opinions, the fruit of the study\nand thought of my whole life. I have held them in silence. I have\nsuffered terribly from griefs which she has never suspected. I have been\nin real torture from my own heart, and I have spared her the pain of\nseeing my agony. I have even suffered at her hands and have never\ncomplained. Have I not seen, from childhood, that she had an\nirresistible preference for my brother, and did I not know, besides,\nthat she thought this due to the oldest and most highly titled of her\nsons? I have conquered the vexation of this wound, and when my brother\nat last permitted me to love him, I did love him devotedly; but before\nthat time how many secret affronts and bitter jests I have brooked from\nhim, and from my mother too, in league with him against the seriousness\nof my thought and life! I bore them no ill-will for this; I understood\ntheir mistakes and prejudices; but without knowing it, they did me much\nharm.\n\n\"In the midst of so many vexations, only one thing could tempt a\nsolitary man like me,--the glory of letters. I felt within me a certain\nfire, an impulse towards the beautiful, which might draw around me\nmanifold sympathies. I saw that this glory would wound my mother in her\nbeliefs, and I determined to keep the most strict incognito, that the\npaternity of my work might not even be suspected. You alone, you only in\nthe whole world, have been intrusted with a secret which is never to be\ndisclosed. I will not add, during my mother\'s lifetime, for I have a\nhorror of these mental reservations, these parricidal schemes, which\nseem like calling death down upon those whom we ought to love better\nthan ourselves. I have said \'never\' in this matter, so as never to\nentertain the idea of any state of things in which a personal\ngratification could lessen my grief at losing my mother.\"\n\n\"Very well! in all this, I like you as much as I admire you,\" replied\nMlle de Saint-Geneix; \"but it strikes me, that with respect to your\nmarriage, it can all be arranged as it ought, with due regard to your\nown wishes and to those of your family. Since they say that Mlle de\nXaintrailles is entirely worthy of you, why, at the moment of assuring\nyourself of this, do you say beforehand that it is neither possible nor\nprobable! This is where I do not comprehend you at all, and where I\ndoubt if you have any serious or respectable reasons that I could be\nbrought to accept.\"\n\nCaroline spoke with a decision which at once changed the resolution of\nthe Marquis. He was on the point of opening his heart to her at all\nhazards; he had felt himself guided onward by a glimmer of hope, of\nwhich she had now deprived him, and he became sad, and seemingly quite\novercome.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" resumed she, \"you can find no answer to this.\"\n\n\"You are not wrong,\" said he; \"I had no right to tell you that I should\ncertainly be indifferent to Mlle de Xaintrailles. I know it myself; but\nyou cannot be a judge of the secret reasons that give me this certainty.\nLet us say no more about her. I expect you to be thoroughly convinced of\nmy independence and clear conscience in this matter. I would not have a\nthought like this remaining in your mind, M. de Villemer is to marry for\nmoney, for position, and for a name. O my friend, never believe that of\nme, I beg of you. To fall so low in your esteem would be a punishment\nwhich I have not merited through any fault, by any wrong against you or\nagainst my family. I expect, likewise, that you will not reproach me, if\nI should happen to find myself obliged openly to oppose my mother\'s\nwishes with regard to my marriage. I have felt it my duty to tell you\nall that justifies me in a pretended eccentricity. Be so good as to\nabsolve me beforehand if, sooner or later, I have to show her and my\nbrother that I will give them my blood, my life, my last franc and even\nmy honor, if need be, but not my moral freedom, not my truth to myself.\nNo, never! These are my own, these are the only possessions I reserve,\nfor they come from God, and man has no claim upon them.\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, the Marquis laid his hand upon his heart with a\nforcible pressure. His face, at once energetic and charming, expressed\nhis enthusiastic faith. Caroline, bewildered, was afraid of having\nunderstood aright and yet equally afraid lest she might have deceived\nherself; but what mattered that which, thus against her will, passed in\nher mind? She must pretend not to suppose that the Marquis could ever\nthink of her. She had great courage and invincible pride. She answered\nthat it was not for her to decide upon the future: but that, for her own\npart, she had loved her father so much that she would have sacrificed\nher own heart even, if, by a complete renunciation of herself, she could\nhave prolonged his life. \"Take care,\" said she with spirit, \"whatever\nyou may decide upon to-day or afterward, always remember this; that when\nbeloved parents are no more, all that we might have done to render their\nlives longer or happier will come before us with terrible eloquence. The\nslightest short-coming then assumes enormous proportions; and there will\nnever be a moment of peace or happiness for one who, even while using\nall his rightful freedom, gains the memory of having seriously grieved a\nmother who is no more.\"\n\nThe Marquis pressed Caroline\'s hand silently and convulsively; she had\nhurt him deeply, for she had spoken the truth.\n\nShe rose, and he conducted her to the carriage again. \"Be content,\" said\nhe, breaking the silence as he was about leaving her. \"I will never\nopenly wound my mother. Pray for me, that I may have eloquence to\nconvince her when the time comes. If I do not succeed--Well, what is\nthat to you? It will be so much the worse for me.\"\n\nHe flung the address to the coachman and disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nIt was no longer possible for Caroline to feel a doubt of the sentiment\nshe had inspired. To avoid responding to it, she had but one line of\ndefence, which was to act either as if she had never suspected it, or as\nif she did not suppose the Marquis would dare to speak of it a second\ntime to her, even indirectly. She resolved to discourage him so\ncompletely that he would never recur to the subject, and not to remain\nalone with him long enough for him to lose his natural timidity under\nthe impulse of increasing emotion.\n\nWhen she had thus marked out her course of conduct, she hoped to be at\npeace; but, after all, she had to give way to natural feelings, and sob\nas if her heart would break. She wisely yielded to this grief, saying to\nherself, that, since it must be so, it was better for her to suffer from\na momentary weakness than to struggle against herself too much. She well\nknew that in a direct contest our instinctive self-love awakes, in spite\nof us, and leads us to seek some side issue, some compromise with the\nausterity of duty or destiny. She refused, then, to dream or reflect; it\nwas better for her to hide her head and weep.\n\nShe did not see M. de Villemer again until evening, just as the ordinary\nvisitors of the family were taking leave; he came in with the Duke, both\nof them in evening dress. They had just returned from the residence of\nthe Duchess de Dunières.\n\nCaroline would have retired immediately. The Marchioness detained her,\nsaying, \"O, so much the worse, my dear, you will have to sit up a little\nlater this evening. It\'s worth while though; we are going to hear what\nhas happened.\"\n\nBefore long the explanation was forthcoming. The Duke had an undefined\nlook as of astonishment; but the countenance of the Marquis was open and\ncalm. \"Mother,\" said he, \"I have seen Mlle de Xaintrailles. She is\nbeautiful, amiable, full of attractions; I can\'t imagine any sentiments\nwhich she might not inspire in the man who has the good fortune to\nplease her; but I have had no such good fortune. She would n\'t look at\nme twice,--so entirely did the first glance suffice for her to pass\njudgment on me.\"\n\nAnd as the Marchioness was silent in utter consternation, the Marquis\ntook her hands, adding, as he kissed them, \"But this need n\'t affect you\nthe least in the world. On the contrary, I have come back full of dreams\nand plans and hopes. There is in the air--O, I felt it at once--quite\nanother marriage than this, and one which will give you infinitely more\npleasure!\"\n\nCaroline felt herself dying and reviving by turns at every word she\nheard; but she also knew the eyes of the Duke were fastened upon her,\nand she said to herself that perhaps the Marquis was stealthily watching\nher, between each of his phrases. So she kept her countenance. It was\nplain that she had wept; but her sister\'s departure might be the only\ncause. She had acknowledged it, and the Marquis had himself witnessed\nher tears on that occasion.\n\n\"Come, my son,\" said the Marchioness, \"don\'t keep me in suspense, and if\nyou are talking seriously--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the Duke, mincing gracefully, \"it is n\'t serious.\"\n\n\"But, indeed, it is,\" cried Urbain, who was unusually gay; \"it\'s on the\nprogramme for the most plausible and delightful thing in the world!\"\n\n\"It\'s singular enough, at least--and spicy enough,\" rejoined the Duke.\n\n\"Come now, do stop your riddles,\" cried the Marchioness.\n\n\"Well, let us have it,\" said the Duke to his brother with a smile.\n\n\"I propose to do that; I ask nothing better,\" replied the Marquis; \"it\'s\nquite a story, and I must proceed with it in order. Imagine, my dear\nmamma, our arrival at the Duchess\'s, both as fine as you see us\nnow,--no, finer still, for there was on our faces that air of conquest\nwhich suits my brother so well, and which I attempted for the first\ntime, but with no success at all, as you shall see.\"\n\n\"That means,\" rejoined the Duke, \"that you had an air of prodigious\nabstraction, and began operations by looking at a portrait of Anne of\nAustria, lately placed in the drawing-room of the Duchess, instead of\nlooking at Mlle de Xaintrailles.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Marchioness, sighing, \"it was very lovely then, this\nportrait?\"\n\n\"Very lovely,\" replied Urbain. \"You will say it was no time for me to be\nnoticing this; but you are going to see how fortunate it was, after all,\nthat it happened. Mlle Diana was seated by the corner of the mantel;\nwith Mlle de Dunières and two or three other young ladies of haughty\nancestry more or less English. While my distracted eyes are hanging upon\nthe plump countenance of our late queen, Gaëtan, thinking me close at\nhis heels, goes directly, in his capacity of elder brother, to salute\nfirst the Duchess, then her daughter and the whole juvenile group,\nsingling out at once, with an eagle eye, the beautiful Diana, whom he\nhad n\'t seen since she was five years old. Having promenaded his\nbewitching smile into this privileged corner, and traversed the other\ngroups with that meek and triumphant elegance which belongs to him\nalone, he returns to me, just as I am beginning my evolution toward the\nDuchess, and says in an angry tone though in a low voice, \'Come on! what\nare you about there?\' I dart forward, I salute the Duchess in my turn, I\ntry to look at my betrothed; she had her back turned to me squarely. An\nevil omen! I retreat to the mantel-piece, in order to display all my\nadvantages. The Duchess addresses some conversation to me, charitably\nbent on giving me a chance to shine. And I--why, I was ready to talk\nlike a book; but it was all for nothing; Mlle de Xaintrailles never\nlooked at me and listened still less; she was whispering to her young\ncompanions. At last she turns round and darts at me a glance full of\nwonder and most decidedly cool. I am introduced to her neighbor, Mlle de\nDunières, a young girl slightly deformed, but brilliant intellectually\nit seemed to me, and who was very evidently nudging her friend with her\nelbow; but all in vain, and I return to my rostrum, that is, to the\nmantel-piece, without having called up the faintest blush. I do not lose\nmy self-possession, but, resuming conversation with the Duke, I go on\nmaking some very judicious remarks about the session of the Chambers,\nwhen, all at once, I hear the music of charming bursts of laughter,\npoorly suppressed, from the young ladies in the corner. Probably they\nfound me stupid. I am not confounded, however; I continue; and after\nhaving properly shown the fluency of my elocution, I inquire about the\nhistorical portrait, to the great satisfaction of the Duke de Dunières,\nwho thinks of nothing but having his picture appreciated. While he is\nleading me toward it to examine it and admire the beauty of its\nexecution, my brother quietly takes my place and on my return I find him\ninstalled between the arm-chair of the Duchess and that of her daughter,\nclose by Mlle Diana, in the midst of the group, joining in the chat of\nthe young ladies.\"\n\n\"Is this true, my son?\" asked the Marchioness of the Duke, with anxiety.\n\n\"It is quite true,\" replied the Duke, ingenuously. \"I laid siege to the\nfortress; I took a position. I expected Urbain to manœuvre so as to\ncome to my support; but no, the traitor leaves me alone exposed to the\nfire, and you see I have to get off as I can. What took place meanwhile?\nHe is going to tell you.\"\n\n\"Alas! I know more than enough,\" said the Marchioness, in despair; \"he\nwas thinking of something else.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, mamma,\" replied the Marquis, \"I had no wish to do so and no\ntime either, for the Duchess, leaving Gaëtan engaged with the young\nladies, took me aside, and, laughing in spite of herself, said these\nmemorable words, which I report _verbatim_: \'My dear Marquis, what has\ntaken place here this evening is like a scene in a comedy. Just imagine\nto yourself that the young person--whom it is useless to name--takes you\nfor your brother, and consequently persists in taking your brother for\nyou. We tell her she is mistaken, but all in vain; she will have it that\nwe are deceiving her, that she is not to be taken in so--and--must I\ntell you the whole?\'\n\n\"\'Yes, certainly, Madame de Dunières; you are too much my mother\'s\nfriend to let me sail on a false course!\'\n\n\"\'Yes, yes, that \'s it! I ought not to leave you on the wrong track, I\nshould be really distressed at that, and you must know at once how\nmatters stand. They find the Duke charming, and you--\'\n\n\"\'And me absurd? Come! be frank clear to the end.\'\n\n\"\'You! You are not thought of at all, you are not seen, you are nothing,\nno one is heard but the Duke! If I did n\'t know you were very fond of\nyour brother, I should never tell you this--\'\n\n\"I reassured the Duchess so earnestly, I expressed so much joy over the\nidea that my brother was preferred to me, that she replied, \'Well done!\nwhy, here we are in a romance! When it is known the Duke is the one who\npleases, don\'t you expect a great outcry?\'\n\n\"\'Why, who will make it? You, Madame de Dunières?\'\n\n\"\'Perhaps so, but it \'s certain _she_ will! Well, now, all this must be\nexplained. Come with me and see what is going on; we cannot part on the\nstrength of a _quid pro quo._\'\n\n\"\'No, no,\' I said to the Duchess, \'you must listen to me first. Here I\nhave a cause to plead which is a hundred times dearer than my own. You\nhave said something that alarms me, at which I feel a real concern, and\nI beg you will take it back. You seem disposed to decide against my\nbrother in case your amiable god-daughter should pardon him for not\nbeing the Marquis. As I am sure, now, that she will pardon him without\ndifficulty, if she has not done so already, I want to understand your\nobjections to him, in order to do battle against them. My brother has,\non his father\'s side, a descent far more illustrious than my own; he has\nall the traits of a true gentleman, and all the attractions of an\nagreeable man; as for me, I am not a man of the world, and, if I must\navow all, I have some tendency toward being a liberal.\'\n\n\"The Duchess made a gesture of horror; then she began to laugh, thinking\nI was in jest.\"\n\n\"Knowing you were in jest, my son!\" interposed the Marchioness, in a\ntone of reproach.\n\n\"Good or poor,\" rejoined the Marquis, \"the joke had no ill effect. The\nDuchess let me set off my brother\'s merits, agreed with me that a man of\nrank, who has never forfeited his honor, has a right to ruin himself\nfinancially, that a life of pleasure has always been well received in\nhigh circles, when there is wisdom enough to leave it behind in season,\nto accept poverty nobly, and to show one\'s self superior to one\'s\nfollies. Finally, I appealed to the friendship of the Duchess for you,\nto the desire she had felt for an alliance with you on the part of her\ngod-daughter, and I had the good fortune to be so persuasive that she\npromised not to influence the choice of Mlle de Xaintrailles.\"\n\n\"Ah! my son, what have you done?\" cried the Marchioness, trembling. \"I\nrecognize your good heart in it all, but it is a dream! A girl brought\nup in a convent will certainly be afraid of a conquering hero like this\nvain fellow. She would never dare to trust him.\"\n\n\"Stop, mother,\" resumed the Marquis, \"I have n\'t finished my story. When\nwe returned to the young ladies, Mile. Diana was calling my brother\n\'Your Grace,\' as boldly as you please. She was talking and laughing with\nhim, and I was allowed to aid him in shining before her. However, he had\nno great need of me. She drew him out brilliantly herself, and I found\nshe was n\'t sorry to show us in her replies that she was quite witty,\nand that mirth suited her excellently.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the Duke, carried away by an irresistible\ninfatuation, \"she is bewitching, this little Diana, whom I have seen\nplaying with her dolls! I reminded her of it, for I did n\'t wish to\nimpose upon her as to my age--\"\n\n\"And to this,\" continued the Marquis, \"I added that you were fibbing to\nher, that it was I who had seen the doll, and that you were a child in\nthe cradle then; but Mlle Diana would n\'t let me suppose that she saw in\nme the material for a Duke. \'No, no, monsieur, the Marquis,\' said she,\nlaughing, \'your brother here is thirty-six years old, I know all about\nit.\' And this was said with a tone, with an air--\"\n\n\"That drove me distracted, I admit it,\" said the Duke, rising and\ntossing his mother\'s spectacles up to the ceiling, catching them again\nadroitly; \"but, see, all this is folly! Mlle Diana is an artless and\nadorable little coquette--a thorough school-girl, a little wild over her\napproaching entrance into society, preparing herself in the retirement\nof her family circle to keep all heads turned, until at last her own is\nturned also; but it \'s too soon now! To-morrow morning, after she has\nthought it over--And then they will tell her such naughty things about\nme!\"\n\n\"To-morrow night you will see her again,\" said the Marquis, \"so you can\ncounteract the evil influences, if any such are near her, and I don\'t\nbelieve there will be. Don\'t make yourself more interesting than you\nreally are, brother mine! Besides, the Duchess is on your side, and she\ndid n\'t let you go without saying, \'_Come again soon. We are at home\nevery evening: we don\'t go into society till after Advent_,\'--which\nmeans, in good plain French: \'There is still a whole month before my\ndaughter and god-daughter will see the gay world. It is for you to\nplease before they are intoxicated with dress and balls. We receive but\nfew young people now, and it only remains for you to be the youngest,\nthat is, the most eager and the most fortunate.\'\"\n\n\"Bless me, bless me!\" said the Marchioness, \"I feel myself in a dream.\nMy poor Duke! And I never so much as thought of you. Why, I--I imagined\nyou had won so many women that you would never find one simple enough,\ngenerous enough; wise enough, after all; for here you are, reformed, and\nI dare say you will make the Duchess d\'Aléria perfectly happy.\"\n\n\"I can answer for that, mother,\" cried the Duke. \"What has made me bad\nis suspicion, experience of coquettes and ambitious women; but a\ncharming young girl, a child of sixteen, who is willing to trust me,\nruined as I am--but I should become a child again myself! And you would\nbe very happy too, would n\'t you? And you, Urbain, who were so afraid\nyou would have to marry?\"\n\n\"Has he taken a vow of celibacy, then?\" asked the Marchioness, looking\nat the Marquis with tenderness.\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Urbain, with some spirit, \"but you see there has\nbeen no time lost, as my elder brother still makes such fine conquests!\nIf you will give me a few months more for reflection--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, indeed! there is no real haste,\" rejoined the Marchioness;\n\"and since we have such good fortune, I trust in the future--and in you,\nmy excellent friend!\"\n\nShe embraced her two sons, evidently intoxicated with joy and hope. She\naddressed her children in the most familiar and affectionate way, and\nalso embraced Caroline, exclaiming, \"You good pretty little blonde! you\nmust rejoice too!\"\n\nCaroline had more disposition to rejoice than she cared to admit, even\nto herself. Overcome with fatigue after the excitement of the day, she\nslept delightfully; with the assurance that the crisis had been\npostponed, and that some time, at least, must elapse before she would\nsee the final and irrevocable obstacle of marriage come between herself\nand M. de Villemer.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThe Marchioness slept little. Her impatience for the morrow almost\nstifled her. Want of sleep took away her spirits. She viewed everything\non its dark side, and expected to find the whole a delusion; but when\nCaroline brought in her correspondence, there was a letter from the\nDuchess that transported her with joy. \"My friend,\" said Madame de\nDunières, \"here is a change of scene like those at the opera. It is the\ncase of your eldest son that demands attention. I talked with Diana when\nshe awoke this morning. I did not asperse the Duke, but my religion\nobliged me not to hide from her any of the truth. She replied that I had\nsaid all this before, in speaking of the Marquis, that I had nothing to\ntell her which she had not already considered, and that on mature\nreflection, she had become equally interested in the two brothers, whose\nfriendship was such a beautiful thing, and that, in thinking over the\nposition of the Duke, she had found it more meritorious to have borne\nthe burden of gratitude nobly than to have rendered a service exacted by\nduty.\" She added that, \"Since I had counselled her to bestow happiness\nand wealth on some worthy man, she felt herself drawn toward him who\npleased her best. In fine, the irresistible graces of your\ngood-for-nothing son have done the rest. And then I must not be mistaken\nabout Diana. She judges that the title of Duchess will suit her queenly\nfigure best: she is inclined to be fond of society; and when, not long\nago, some one, I know not who, told her that the Marquis did not like it\nat all, I saw she was uneasy, though I did not know the reason. Now she\nhas confessed all. She has said to me that as a brother the Marquis\nwould be all she could desire, but that as a husband the Duke would show\nher the gayest life. In short, my dear, she seems so determined that I\nhave only to serve you all I can in this unforeseen contingency as I\nshould have done in the other case.\n\n\"I will bring my daughter to you to-morrow morning, and as Diana will be\nwith us, you can see her without appearing to suspect anything; but you\nwill succeed in charming her completely, I am very sure.\"\n\nWhile the Marchioness and the Duke were giving themselves up to their\nhappiness, Caroline was left a little more alone; for the son and the\nmother held long conversations every day in which her presence was\nnaturally undesired, and during which she practised music or wrote her\nown letters in the drawing-room, always deserted until five o\'clock.\nThere she disturbed no one, and held herself in readiness to answer the\nleast summons of the Marchioness.\n\nOne day the Marquis came in with a book, and seating himself at the same\ntable where she was writing, with an air strangely calm and resolved,\nasked her permission to work in this room, where it was easier to\nbreathe than in his little chamber. \"That is, on condition,\" said he,\n\"that I don\'t drive you away, for I see quite clearly that you have\navoided me for some days past; don\'t deny it!\" added he, seeing she was\nabout to reply. \"You have reasons for this which I respect, but which\nare not well grounded. In speaking of myself as I ventured to do at the\nJardin des Plantes I startled the delicacy of your conscience. You\nthought I was going to make you my confidante in some personal project\nlikely to disturb the peace of my family, and you were unwilling to\nbecome even a passive accomplice in my rebellion.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied Caroline, \"you have divined my feeling perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now let my words become as if they had never been said,\" continued\nUrbain, calmly and with a firmness that commanded, respect; \"I will not\ntell you to forget them, but do not dwell on them in any way, I beg, and\nnever fear my bringing your attachment for my mother into collision with\nthe generous friendship you have deigned to accord me.\"\n\nCaroline felt constrained to yield to the power of this frankness. She\ndid not comprehend all that was passing through the mind of the Marquis,\nall that was suppressed behind his words. She thought she must have been\nmistaken, that she had felt too much alarm at a fancy he had already\nconquered. In her own mind she accepted her friend\'s promise as a formal\nreparation for having caused her a moment of troubled thought, and\nthenceforth she found anew the full charm and security of friendship.\n\nThey saw each other, then, every day, and even sometimes for long hours\ntogether, in the drawing-room, almost under the eyes of the Marchioness,\nwho rejoiced to see that Caroline continued to aid the Marquis in his\nlabors. In fact, she assisted him now only with her memory: having\narranged his documents in the country, he wrote his third and last\nvolume with admirable swiftness and readiness. Caroline\'s presence gave\nhim enthusiasm and inspiration. By her side, he no longer suffered from\ndoubt or weariness. She had become so indispensable to him that he\nconfessed his lack of interest in anything when alone. He was pleased to\nhave her talk to him even in the midst of his work. Far from disturbing\nhim this dearly loved voice preserved the harmony of his thought and the\nelevation of his style. He challenged her to disturb him, he begged her\nto read music at the piano, without fear of causing him the least\nannoyance. On the contrary, all that made him sensible of her presence\nfell on his soul like a pleasant warmth; for she was to him, not another\nperson moving about near him, but his own mind which he could see and\nfeel alive before him.\n\nHer respect for his work, over which she was enthusiastic, bound\nCaroline to a certain respect for him personally. She made it a sacred\nduty, as it were, not, in any way, to disturb the balance needful to a\nmind so finely organized. She refused to think of herself any longer.\nShe no longer asked herself whether she was not running some risk on her\nown score, or whether, at a given time, she would be strong enough to\ngive up this intimacy which was becoming the groundwork of her own life.\n\nThe matrimonial alliance between the Duke d\'Aléria and Mlle de\nXaintrailles progressed with encouraging rapidity. The beautiful Diana\nwas seriously in love and would not hear a word against Gaëtan. The\nDuchess de Dunières, having herself made a love-match with a veteran\nlady-killer, who had reformed on the strength of it and now rendered her\nperfectly happy, took the part of her god-daughter, and pleaded her\ncause so well that her guardians and the legal advisers of the family\nhad to give way before the known will of the heiress.\n\nThe latter told her betrothed, even before he had expressed any wish to\nthis effect, that she intended to pay off his indebtedness to the\nMarquis, and the Marquis had to accept the promise of a reparation which\nthis high-minded young girl made one condition of the marriage. All the\nMarquis could obtain was that they should not restore to him the share\nin his mother\'s property which he had resigned when Madame de Villemer\nhad been obliged to pay the debts of her eldest son for the first time.\nAccording to the Marquis, his mother had a right to dispose of her own\nfortune during her lifetime; and he regarded himself as entirely\nindemnified since the Marchioness was to live henceforth at the Hôtel\nde Xaintrailles and in the castles of her daughter-in-law, far more\nsplendid than the little manor of Séval and much nearer Paris, thus\nliving no longer at his expense.\n\nIn these family arrangements all parties showed the most exquisite\ndelicacy and the most honorable generosity. Caroline directed the\nattention of the Marquis to this fact in order to make him insist, in\nhis book, upon certain just reservations in favor of families where the\ntrue idea of nobility still served as the basis of real virtues.\n\nIn fact, here each one did his duty: Mlle de Xaintrailles would have no\nmarriage-contract which, in protecting her fortune from her husband\'s\nlavish expenditures, should contain any clauses likely to wound his\npride; while the Duke, on the other hand, insisted that the right of\ndowry should bind the wings of his magnificent improvidence. So it was\nspecified with considerable flourish in the document that this\nstipulation was introduced at the request of the future bridegroom, and\nin compliance with his express wishes.\n\nEverything being thus settled, the Marchioness found herself a sharer in\na most generous style of living; and although she had declared herself\nsatisfied with a simple promise and willing to rely on the discretion of\nher children, a very handsome income had been secured to her by the same\ncontract in which the future bride had done so many other liberal and\nconsiderate things; the Marquis, on his side, became repossessed of\ncapital enough to represent an ample competence. It is needless to state\nthat he took the recovery of this fortune as calmly as he had borne the\nloss of it.\n\nWhile the outfit of the bride was preparing, the Duke busied himself\nabout his presents for her, the funds for their purchase having been\nforced upon his acceptance by his brother, as a wedding gift. What an\naffair it was for the Duke to choose diamonds and laces and cashmeres!\nHe understood the lofty science of the toilet better than the most\naccomplished woman. He hardly found time to eat, passing his days in\nwaiting upon his betrothed, consulting jewellers, merchants, and\nembroiderers, and telling his mother, who was equally excited over it\nall, the thousand incidents and even the surprising dramas connected\nwith his marvellous acquisitions. Into the midst of all this heavy fire,\nin which Caroline and Urbain took only a modest share, Madame d\'Arglade\nglided, as if in her own despite.\n\nA great event had overturned Léonie\'s way of life and all her plans. At\nthe beginning of the winter, her husband, twenty years her senior and\nfor some time past an invalid, had succumbed to a chronic disease,\nleaving his affairs complicated enough; though she came out of her\nembarrassments in triumphant style, thanks to a lucky stroke at the\nBourse, for she had gambled in stocks a long time without the knowledge\nof M. d\'Arglade, and had at last laid hands on a fortunate number in the\ngreat lottery. So she found herself a widow, still young and handsome,\nand richer than she had ever been before, all which did not hinder her\nshedding so many and such big tears that people said of her with\nadmiration, \"This poor little woman was really attached to her duty, in\nspite of her frivolous ways! Certainly M. d\'Arglade was not a husband to\ngo distracted over, but she has such a warm heart that she is\ninconsolable.\" And thus she was pitied, and many took pains to amuse\nher: the Marchioness, seriously interested, insisted that she should\ncome and pass her solitary afternoons with her. Nothing was more proper;\nit was not going into company, for the Marchioness received no visitors\nuntil four or five o\'clock; it was not even going out, for Léonie could\ncome in a cab without much of a toilet, and as if incognito. Léonie\nallowed herself to be consoled and amused by watching the preparations\nfor the wedding, and sometimes the Duke would succeed in making her\nlaugh outright; which did very well, because, passing from one kind of\nnervous excitement to another, she would immediately begin to sob,\nhiding her face in her handkerchief and saying, \"How cruel you are to\nmake me laugh! It does me so much harm.\"\n\nThrough all her despair, Léonie was contriving to win the intimate\nconfidence of the Marchioness so as insensibly to supplant Caroline, who\ndid not perceive this, and was a thousand leagues from suspecting her\ndesigns. Now Léonie\'s main project was this:--\n\nAs she saw the health of her disagreeable husband becoming impaired and\nher own private purse filling out round, Madame d\'Arglade asked herself\nwhat kind of a successor she should give him, and, as she had not yet\nbeen confidentially informed of the marriage already arranged with Mlle\nde Xaintrailles, she had resolved to confer the right to the vacant\nliving upon the Duke d\'Aléria. She thought him \"ineligible,\" on the\nconditions of fortune united to youth and rank, and said to herself, not\nwithout logic and plausibility, that the widow of a respectable and\nwealthy gentleman, without children, was the best match to which a\npenniless prodigal, reduced to going on foot and reckoning up accounts\nwith his body-servant, could possibly aspire. Léonie then had no doubt\nof her success, and while busying herself with much skill in the\ninvestment of her capital she said to herself in supreme calm, \"Now all\nis finished, I have plenty of money, I will speculate no more, I will\nintrigue no more. My ambition, satiated in this direction, must change\nits object. I must efface the birth-mark of plebeianism, which still\nincommodes me in society. I must have a title. That of Duchess is well\nworth the trouble of some thought!\"\n\nShe had indeed thought of it in time, but M. d\'Arglade died too late.\nShe had scarcely laid aside her first mourning crapes, when, on her\nearliest visit to the Marchioness, she learned that she must think of it\nno longer.\n\nLéonie then turned her batteries on the Marquis de Villemer. This was\nless brilliant and more difficult, but still it was satisfactory as a\ntitle, and, from her point of view, not impossible. The Marchioness was\nextremely anxious about her son\'s bachelor state, the prospect of which\nas a permanency seemed to have new charms for him in his negligence. She\nopened her heart to Madame d\'Arglade. \"He really frightens me,\" said\nshe, \"with his tranquil air. I fear he may have some prejudice--I know\nnot what--against marriage, perhaps against women in general. He is more\nthan timid, he is unsociable, and yet he is charming when you succeed in\nwinning him into familiarity. He needs to meet some woman who will fall\nin love with him herself first, and then have courage enough to make him\nlove her in return.\"\n\nLéonie profited by these revelations. \"Ah! yes,\" replied she, giddily,\n\"he needs a wife of higher position than mine, one who is not the widow\nof the best of men; but somebody who would still have my age, my wealth,\nand my disposition.\"\n\n\"Your disposition is too impulsive for a man so reserved, my darling.\"\n\n\"And that is why a person of my character would save him. You know about\nextremes. If I could love any one, which now, alas! is totally\nimpossible, I should certainly fancy a man who is serious and cold. Dear\nme! Alas! was not that the temperament of my poor husband? Well, his\ngravity tempered my vivacity, and my liveliness let sunshine into his\nmelancholy. That was his way of putting it, and how often he would\nmention it! He had never been in love before he met me, and he also had\nprecisely this distaste for marriage. The first time he saw me, he was a\nlittle afraid of my frivolity; but all at once he saw that I was\nnecessary to his life, because this apparent thoughtlessness, which you\nknow does n\'t hinder one from having a good heart, passed into his soul\nlike a light, like a balm. These were his very words, poor dear man!\nThere! stop! let us not talk about people who marry. It makes me feel\ntoo keenly that I am alone forever!\"\n\nLéonie found means to touch upon the subject so often and under so many\ndifferent forms, with so much tact under an air of innocence, with so\nmany civilities clothed in apparent indifference, that the idea entered\nthe mind of the Marchioness almost without her being conscious of it,\nand when Madame d\'Arglade saw she was not disposed to reject it\nabsolutely in the proper time and place, she began a direct attack on M.\nde Villemer with the same cunning, the same charming heedlessness, the\nsame silence of conjugal despair, the same frank insinuations, bringing\nabout the whole and carrying it on before the eyes of Caroline, about\nwhom she did not trouble herself at all.\n\nBut the chatter of Madame d\'Arglade was disagreeable to the Marquis;\nand, if she had never found this out, it was only because she had never\nprovoked him into taking any notice of her whatever. Far from being the\ninexperienced savage he was supposed to be, he had a very fine tact with\nregard to women; so, at the first assault which Léonie made, he\nunderstood her designs, perceived all her intrigues, and made her feel\nthis so thoroughly that she was wounded to the very heart.\n\nFrom that time she opened her eyes, and, in a thousand delicate\nindications detected the boundless love Mlle de Saint-Geneix had\ninspired in the Marquis. She rejoiced over this greatly: she thought it\nwas in her power to revenge herself, and she waited for the right\nmoment.\n\nThe marriage of the Duke was appointed for one of the first days of\nJanuary; but there were so many outcries in certain rigid drawing-rooms\nof the Faubourg Saint-Germain against the readiness with which the\nDuchess de Dunières had welcomed the suit of this great sinner, that\nshe determined to avoid the reproach of undue precipitation by delaying\nthe happiness of the young pair for three months, and introducing her\ngod-daughter into society. This postponement did not alarm the Duke, but\nvexed the Marchioness exceedingly, for she was eager to open a really\ngrand drawing-room, on her own responsibility, with a charming\ndaughter-in-law, who would attract young faces around her. Madame\nd\'Arglade, under pretext of business, became less assiduous in her\nvisits, and Caroline resumed her duties.\n\nShe was much less impatient than the Marchioness to live at the Hôtel\nde Xaintrailles and to change her habits. The Marquis had not decided to\naccept an apartment at his brother\'s, and did not explain his own\npersonal plans. Caroline was alarmed at this, and yet she saw, in his\nindifference to being under the same roof with her, one proof of the\ncalm regard she had exacted from him; but she had now reached that stage\nof affection when logic is often found at fault in the depths of the\nheart. She silently enjoyed her last happy days, and when spring came,\nfor the first time in her life, she regretted winter.\n\nMlle de Xaintrailles had taken Mlle de Saint-Geneix into high favor, and\neven into a close friendship; while, on the contrary, she felt a decided\ndislike for Madame d\'Arglade, whom she met occasionally of a morning at\nthe house of her future mother-in-law, where she herself made no formal\nvisits, but only came with Madame and Mlle de Dunières at hours when\nnone but intimate friends were received. Léonie pretended not to see\nthis slight haughtiness in the beautiful Diana. She thought she had a\nhold on her happiness also, and that she could revenge herself upon her\nand upon Caroline at one and the same time.\n\nShe was not invited to the wedding festivities; her mourning, of course,\npreventing her appearance there. However, from regard to the\nMarchioness, toward whom Diana showed herself really perfect, a few\nbrief words of regret, as to this deprivation, were said to her. That\nwas all. Caroline, on the other hand, was chosen as a bridesmaid, and\nloaded with gifts, by the future Duchess d\'Aléria.\n\nAt last the great day arrived, and for the first time, after many years\nof sorrow and misery, Mlle de Saint-Geneix, dressed in elegant taste,\nand even with a certain richness, through the gifts of the bride,\nappeared in all the splendor of her beauty and grace. She created a\nlively sensation, and every one inquired where this delightful unknown\ncould have come from. Diana replied, \"She is a friend of mine, a very\nsuperior person who is under the care of my mother-in-law, and whom I am\ndelighted to see established so near me.\"\n\nThe Marquis danced with the bride and also with Mlle de Dunières, in\norder that he might afterwards dance with Mlle de Saint-Geneix. Caroline\nwas so astonished at this that she could not help saying to him in a low\nvoice, and with a smile, \"How is this? After having stood by each other\nthrough the establishment of allodial rule and the enfranchisement of\nthe lower classes, now we are going to dance a contra-dance!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, quickly, \"and this will go much better, for I shall\nfeel your hand in mine.\"\n\nIt was the first time the Marquis had openly shown Caroline an emotion\nin which the senses had any part. Now she was sensible of his trembling\nhand and his eager eyes. She was frightened; but reminded herself that\nhe had seemed to be in love with her once before and had triumphed over\nthe ill-advised thought. With a man so pure and of such high morality\nought she to feel afraid, even if he did forget himself for an instant!\nAnd besides, had she not herself experienced this vague intoxication of\nlove even when her will was strong enough to subdue it at once! She\ncould not help being aware of her own extraordinary beauty, for every\neye told her of it. She eclipsed the bride herself in her diamonds, with\nher seventeen years, and her fine smile of fond triumph. The dowagers\nsaid to the Duchess de Dunières, \"That poor orphan you have there is\ntoo pretty: it is disquieting!\" The sons of the Duchess herself, young\nmen of dignity and great promise, looked at Mlle de Saint-Geneix in a\nway that justified the apprehensions of these experienced matrons. The\nDuke, touched by seeing that his generous wife had not thought of\nharboring the slightest jealous suspicion, and also appreciating\nCaroline\'s considerate attitude toward him, showed her especial\nattention. The Marchioness, not to spoil this delightful day, made a\npoint of treating her more maternally than ever, and of dispelling every\nshadow of servitude. In short, she was in one of those moments of life,\nwhen, in spite of fortune\'s caprices, the power which intelligence,\nhonor, and beauty naturally exert seem to reclaim its rights and to\nreconquer its place in the world.\n\nBut if Caroline read her triumph on all faces, it was especially in the\neyes of M. de Villemer that she could assure herself of it. She also\nnoticed how this mysterious man had altered since that first day when he\nhad appeared so timid, so self-absorbed, as if obstinately bent on\nremaining in obscurity. He was now as elegant in his manners as his\nelder brother, with more true grace and real distinction; for the Duke,\nin spite of his great knowledge of demeanor, had a little of that\nbearing, a shade too fine and slightly theatrical, which is\ncharacteristic of the Spanish race. The Marquis was of the French type\nin all its unaffected ease, in all its amiable kindliness, in that\nparticular charm which does not impress but wins. He danced, that is, he\nwalked through the contra-dance more simply than any one else; but the\npurity of his life had imparted to his motions, his countenance, his\nwhole being, a perfume, as one might say, of extraordinary youth. He\nseemed, this evening, to be ten years younger than his brother, and a\ncertain indescribable glow of hope gave his face the brightness of a\nbeautiful life just commencing.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nAt midnight, the newly married couple having discreetly disappeared, the\nMarchioness signified to her son that she was tired and would like to\nwithdraw. \"Give me your arm, dear child,\" said she, when he came to her\nside; \"let us not disturb Caroline, who is dancing; I will leave her\nunder the protection of Madame de D----.\"\n\nAnd as the Marquis was helping her through the corridor leading to her\nown room on the lower floor,--they had been considerate enough to humor\nher distrust of staircases, \"My dear son,\" she said, \"you will no longer\nhave the trouble of carrying on your arm your poor little bundle of a\nmother. You did it very often when you were with us at the other house,\nand with you I did not seem afraid; but it pained me to give you the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"And I--I shall regret that lost pleasure,\" said Urbain.\n\n\"How elegant and aristocratic this reception is!\" resumed the\nMarchioness, having at last reached her apartment; \"and this Caroline\nwho is its queen! I am astonished at the beauty and grace the little\ncreature has.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said the Marquis, \"are you really very tired just now? and if\nI should ask fifteen minutes\' conversation with you--\"\n\n\"Let us talk, my son, by all means!\" cried the Marchioness. \"I was tired\nonly because I could not talk with those I love. And then I was afraid\nof seeming ridiculous, in case I said too much about my happiness. Let\nus speak of it, let us speak of your brother, and of yourself as well!\nCome, will you not bring a second day like this into my life?\"\n\n\"Dear mother,\" said the Marquis, kneeling before her and taking both her\nhands in his, \"it depends upon you alone whether I, too, shall soon have\nmy day of supreme joy.\"\n\n\"Ah! what do you say? Truly? Tell me quickly then!\"\n\n\"Yes, I will speak. This is the moment I was waiting for; I have held\nmyself in reserve, and turned all my longings toward this blessed hour,\nwhen my brother, reconciled to God, to truth, and to himself, could take\na wife worthy to be your daughter. And when such a moment came I\nintended to say this: Mother, I also can present you with a second\ndaughter, more lovely than the first and no less pure. For a year, for\nmore than a year, I have devotedly loved a most perfect being. She has\nsuspected this perhaps, but she does not know it; I have so much respect\nand esteem for her that without your consent I well knew I should never\ngain her own. Besides, she gave me to understand this sharply one day,\none single day, when my secret came near escaping me in spite of myself,\nfour months ago, and I have since kept strict silence in her presence\nand in yours. It was my duty not to plunge you into anxieties which,\nthank God! no longer exist. Your fate, my brother\'s, and my own are\nhenceforth secure. Now, comfortably rich, I may properly refuse to\nenlarge my fortune, and I can marry according to my inclinations. You\nhave a sacrifice to make for me nevertheless; but your motherly love\nwill not refuse, for it involves the happiness of my whole life. This\nlady belongs to an honorable family; you made sure of this yourself\nbefore you admitted her to intimacy with you; but she does not belong to\none of those ancient and illustrious lines, for which you have a\npreference that I do not mean to oppose. I said you would have to make a\nsacrifice for me; will you do it? Do you love me enough? Yes, mother,\nyes, your heart, which I can feel beating, will yield without regret, in\nits vast maternal tenderness, to the prayer of a son who worships you.\"\n\n\"Ah, bless me! you are speaking of Caroline,\" cried the Marchioness,\ntrembling. \"Stop, stop, my son! The shock is rude, and I was not\nprepared for it.\"\n\n\"O, do not say that!\" resumed the Marquis, warmly; \"if the shock is too\nrude, I do not want you to bear it. I will give it all up; I will never\nmarry--\"\n\n\"Never marry! Why, that would be worse still! Come, come, do let me know\nwhere I am! It is, perhaps, easier to bear than it seems. It is not so\nmuch her birth. Her father was knighted: that\'s nothing very great; but\nif that was really all! There is this poverty which has fallen upon her.\nYou may tell me that but for you I should have fallen into it myself;\nbut I should have died, while she--she has courage to work for a living,\nand to accept a kind of domestic service--\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" cried the Marquis, \"would you make a blemish of what is the\ncrowning merit of her life?\"\n\n\"No, no, not I,\" returned the Marchioness, eagerly, \"quite the contrary;\nbut the world is so--\"\n\n\"So unjust and so blind!\"\n\n\"That is true too, and I was wrong to let it influence me. Come! we are\nin the midst of love-matches, so I have only one more objection to make.\nCaroline is twenty-five years old--\"\n\n\"And I am now over thirty-four myself.\"\n\n\"It is not that. She is young enough, if her heart is as pure, as\nunsophisticated as your own; but she has been in love before.\"\n\n\"No. I know her whole life. I have conversed with her sister; she was to\nhave married, but she has never really loved.\"\n\n\"Still, between this projected marriage and the time when she came to us\nsome years must have elapsed--\"\n\n\"I have inquired about this. I know her life day by day and almost hour\nby hour. If I tell you that Mlle de Saint-Geneix is worthy of you and of\nme, it is because I know it. A foolish passion has not blinded me. No, a\nserious love based upon reflection, upon comparison with all other\nwomen, upon certainty, has given me strength to keep silence and to\nwait, wishing to convince you on good grounds.\"\n\nThe Marquis talked with his mother some time longer, and he triumphed.\nHe used all the eloquence of passion, and all that filial tenderness of\nwhich he had given so many proofs. His mother was touched and yielded.\n\n\"Well, now,\" cried the Marquis, \"will you let me call her here on your\nbehalf? Are you willing that, for the first time,--in your presence, at\nyour feet,--I should tell her that I love her? See, I yet dare not tell\nher alone! One cold look, one word of distrust, would break my heart.\nHere, in your presence, I can speak, I will convince her.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the Marchioness, \"you have my promise. And you see,\"\nadded she, taking him in her feeble arms, \"if I have not given it with\nvery impulsive joy, it is at least with tenderness unlimited and\nunalloyed. I ask, I exact one single thing; that is, that you will take\ntwenty-four hours to reflect upon your position. It is new, for here you\nare in possession of my consent, which you thought more than doubtful an\nhour ago. Up to that time you believed yourself parted from Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix by obstacles that you did not think of overcoming so\neasily, perhaps, and this may have given illusive strength to your\nfeelings for her. Don\'t shake your head! What do you know about it\nyourself? Besides, what I ask is a very little thing,--twenty-four hours\nwithout speaking to her, that is all. For myself, I feel the need of\naccepting completely before God the decision I have just reached; that\nmy face, my agitation, my tears, may not lead Caroline to suspect that\nit has cost me something--\"\n\n\"O yes, you are right,\" exclaimed the Marquis. \"If she suspected that,\nshe never would let me speak to her. To-morrow, then, dear mother.\nTwenty-four hours, did you say? It is very long! And then,--it is one\no\'clock in the morning. Will you be up again to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"Yes, for we have a concert to-morrow at the apartments of the young\nDuchess. You see why we must sleep to-night. Are you going back to the\nball-room?\"\n\n\"Ah! please let me: she is there still, and she is so lovely with her\nwhite dress and the pearls. I have not looked at her enough, really. I\ndid not dare--now only shall I truly see her.\"\n\n\"Well! make this sacrifice for me in your turn, not to look at her\nagain,--not to speak to her before to-morrow evening. Promise me, as you\nhave no idea of sleeping, to think of her, of me, and of yourself, all\nalone, for a few hours, and then again to-morrow morning. You are not to\ncome here before dinner-time. You must not; promise me!\"\n\nThe Marquis promised and kept his word; but the solitude, the darkness,\nthe pain of not seeing Caroline, and of leaving her surrounded by the\nnotice and homage of others, only increased his impatience, only fed the\nfire of his passion. Besides, his mother\'s precautions, although wise in\nthemselves, were of no use to a man who had been reflecting and deciding\nso long.\n\nCaroline was surprised not to see the Marquis reappear, and was one of\nthe first to withdraw,--trying to persuade herself she had not been\nmistaken in thinking he would soon recover his self-control. She was, as\nwill be seen, far from suspecting the truth.\n\nMadame d\'Arglade had her spies at this ball, and among others a man who\ndesired to marry her, a secretary of legation, who, the next morning,\nreported to her the great success of the \"young lady companion.\" The\ndevotion of the Marquis had not escaped malevolent eyes, and the\ndiplomatic apprentice had even scented out an interesting conversation\nbetween the Marquis and his mother, as they left the room together.\n\nLéonie listened to this report with apparent indifference; but she said\nto herself it was time to act, and at noon she was inquiring for the\nMarchioness at the very moment Caroline appeared.\n\n\"One minute, my dear friend,\" said she to Mlle de Saint-Geneix, \"let me\ngo in before you do; it is an urgent matter,--a kindness to be done for\nsome poor people who wish to remain unknown.\"\n\nOnce alone with the Marchioness, she apologized for coming to speak\nabout the poor in these days of rejoicing. \"They are, on the contrary,\nthe days of the poor,\" replied the generous lady; \"speak. One of my\ngreat joys now will be that I can do more good than I could awhile ago.\"\n\nLéonie had her pretext all prepared. When she had presented her\nrequest, and put the Marchioness down on her subscription-list, she\npretended that she was in haste to go, so as to be invited to stay a\nlittle while. It is useless to relate the skilful turns and tricks by\nwhich she maliciously contrived to reach the interesting point of the\nconversation. These mean-spirited attacks, unhappily too common, will be\nremembered by all those who have ever felt their cruel effects; and they\nare very few who have been forgotten by calumny.\n\nThey naturally spoke of Gaëtan\'s happiness and about the perfections of\nthe young Duchess. \"What I love most in her,\" said Léonie, \"is that she\nisn\'t jealous of any one, not even of--Oh! beg pardon, the name was\njust going to escape me.\"\n\nShe returned to this subject several times, refusing to mention the name\nuntil the Marchioness began to grow uneasy. At last it did escape her,\nand the name was that of Caroline.\n\nShe hastened to take it back, to say her tongue had tripped; but in ten\nminutes the blow had been dealt by a sure hand, and the Marchioness had\ndrawn from her a solemn asseveration that she had seen, with her own\neyes seen, at Séval, the Duke conducting Caroline back to her room at\ndaybreak, and holding both her hands in his, talking to her eagerly, for\nthree good minutes, at the foot of the Renard stairway.\n\nUpon this she made the Marchioness, whose word she knew was sacred,\npromise not to betray her, not to make her enemies,--because so far she\nhad never had any; saying she was in despair at the persistence which\nhad drawn this disclosure from her, that she would have done better to\ndisobey the Marchioness outright, that at heart she really loved\nCaroline, and that, after all, since she had answered for her character,\nit was, perhaps, her duty to confess that she had been mistaken.\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the Marchioness thoroughly mistress of herself, \"all\nthis is not so serious. She may have been very good otherwise, and yet\nhave been impressed by this irresistible Duke. He is so skilful! Have no\nfear. I am to know nothing of this, and I will act at the proper time\nand place, if need be, without its appearing at all.\"\n\nWhen Caroline entered just as Léonie was going, the latter extended her\nhand with a good-natured air, telling her that the news of her triumph\nthe evening before had reached her even, and that she offered her\ncongratulations.\n\nCaroline found the Marchioness so pale as to arouse her anxiety, and on\nasking the cause she received a very cool reply. \"It is the fatigue of\nall this festivity,\" said the Marchioness; \"it is nothing. Be so good as\nto read me my letters.\"\n\nWhile Caroline was reading Madame de Villemer did not listen. She was\nthinking of what she was going to do. She was concealing deep\nindignation against the young girl, a violent grief at the blow she\nwould have to inflict on the Marquis; and with this maternal sorrow\nmingled the involuntary satisfaction of a titled lady at being released\nfrom a promise which had cost her much, and to which, for twelve hours,\nshe had not recurred without a shudder.\n\nWhen she had reached her decision, she interrupted the reading harshly,\nsaying, in an icy tone, \"That is enough, Mlle de Saint-Geneix. I want to\nspeak with you seriously. One of my sons, I need not say which, seems\nlately to have entertained sentiments for you which you surely have not\nencouraged?\"\n\nCaroline turned as pale as the Marchioness; but, strong in her own\nconscience, she replied without hesitation, \"I am ignorant of what you\nassert, Madame. Neither of your sons has ever expressed to me any\nsentiments at which I could be seriously alarmed.\"\n\nThe Marchioness took this reply for an audacious falsehood. She flung at\nthe poor girl one contemptuous look, and for a moment was silent; then\nshe resumed, \"I shall not speak of the Duke; it is entirely useless to\ndefend yourself on this point.\"\n\n\"I have no complaint to make of him or of his brother,\" replied\nCaroline.\n\n\"I suppose not!\" said the Marchioness, with a withering smile; \"but as\nfor me, I should have good cause for complaint if you had the\npresumption--\"\n\nCaroline interrupted the Marchioness with a violence she could not\ncontrol. \"I have shown no presumption,\" cried she, \"and no one in the\nworld has a right to speak to me as if I were to blame, or even\nridiculous--Pardon, Madame,\" added she, seeing the Marchioness almost\nfrightened by her excitement; \"I have interrupted you. I have spoken\nrudely. Forgive me. I love you,--I love you so that I would give you my\nlife willingly. You see why your suspicion hurts me so that I lose my\ntemper. But I ought to control myself; I will control myself! I see\nthere is some misunderstanding between us. Be so good as to explain--or\nquestion me. I will answer with all the calmness in my power.\"\n\n\"My dear Caroline,\" said the Marchioness, more gently, \"I do not\nquestion you. I warn you. It is not my intention to condemn you or\nsadden you with useless questions. You were mistress of your own\nheart--\"\n\n\"No, Madame, I was not.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Very well, the truth comes out in spite of you,\" said the\nMarchioness, with a return of her ironical disdain.\n\n\"No, a hundred times no!\" rejoined Caroline, indignantly. \"That is not\nwhat I mean. Knowing that a thousand duties, some more serious than\nothers, forbade me to dispose of it, I have given it to no one.\"\n\nThe Marchioness looked at Caroline with astonishment. \"How well she\nunderstands lying!\" thought Madame de Villemer. Then she said to herself\nthat, so far as the Duke was concerned, this poor girl was not obliged\nto betray herself; that the feeling she had entertained for him ought to\nbe regarded just as if it had never been, since, after all, she had made\nhim no trouble and claimed no rights detrimental to his marriage.\n\nThis idea, which had but just occurred to her, suddenly mollified the\nrancor of the Marchioness; and when she saw her silence was wounding\nCaroline, whose eyes were full of scalding tears, she returned to her\nfriendship for her, and even to a new kind of esteem.\n\n\"My dear little one,\" said she, extending her hands to her, \"forgive me!\nI have hurt your feelings; I have explained myself wretchedly. Let us\neven admit I was unjust for a moment. In point of fact I understand you\nbetter than you think, and I appreciate your conduct. You are unselfish,\nprudent, generous, and wise. If you have chanced--to think more of\ncertain attentions than was for your own happiness, it is none the less\ncertain you have always stood ready to make sacrifices on occasion, and\nyou would be ready to do the same again; it is so, is it not?\"\n\nCaroline did not comprehend, and could not comprehend that in all this\nthere was an allusion to Gaëtan\'s marriage. She thought only his\nbrother\'s case was called in question; and as she had never relaxed her\nself-control for a moment, she felt as if the Marchioness had no right\nto pry into the painful secrets of her heart. \"I have never had any\nsacrifice to make,\" replied she, haughtily. \"If you have orders for me\ngive them, Madame, and do not think it any merit on my part to obey\nyou.\"\n\n\"You mean to say, and you do say, my dear, that you have never responded\nto the sentiments of the Marquis?\"\n\n\"I have never known them.\"\n\n\"You had never suspected them?\"\n\n\"No, Madame; and I do not believe in them! Who could have made you\nsuppose the contrary? Certainly not the Marquis himself.\"\n\n\"Well, pardon me, but it was he. You see what confidence I have in you.\nI tell you the truth. I trust to your generosity without hesitation. My\nson loves you and thinks he may have won your love in return.\"\n\n\"Monsieur the Marquis is strangely mistaken,\" replied Caroline, wounded\nby an avowal which, presented thus, was almost an offence.\n\n\"Ah! you are telling the truth now, I see that,\" cried the Marchioness,\ndeceived by the pride of Mlle de Saint-Geneix; and wishing to control\nher by means of her self-respect, the old lady kissed her on the\nforehead. \"Thank you, my dear child,\" said she, \"you restore me to life.\nYou are sincere; you are too noble to punish my doubts by trifling with\nmy peace. Very well; now let me tell my son Urbain that he has been only\ndreaming, that this marriage is impossible, not through my opposition,\nbut through yours.\"\n\nThis imprudent request enlightened Caroline. She understood the\nadmirable delicacy which had led the Marquis to consult his mother\nbefore declaring his feelings to her; but she was not deluded by this\ndiscovery, for she saw how much the Marchioness disliked the idea of\ntheir marriage. She attributed this severity to the ambition of Madame\nde Villemer, which she had known perfectly and feared for a long time.\nShe was very far from thinking that, after having yielded the point with\na good grace, the Marchioness was now withdrawing her consent because\nshe believed in the stain of a fault. \"Madame de Villemer,\" replied she,\nwith a certain severity, \"you are never wrong in the eyes of your son. I\nunderstand that; and I fear no reproaches from him, if, on my own part,\nI decline the honor he would do me. Over and above this you can tell him\nwhat you think best; I shall not be here to contradict you.\"\n\n\"What! do you want to leave me?\" cried Madame de Villemer, alarmed at a\nconclusion which she did not expect so suddenly, although she had\nsecretly desired it. \"No, no, that is impossible! It would ruin\neverything. My son loves you with an earnestness,--whose future\nconsequences I do not fear, if you will help me to contend against them,\nbut whose violence at the first moment I do fear. Stop! He would follow\nyou, perhaps; he is eloquent, he would triumph over your resistance, he\nwould bring you back, and I should be forced to tell him--what I never\nwant to tell him.\"\n\n\"You will never have to say \'No\' to him!\" replied Caroline, still under\na delusion, and nowise suspecting this menace of her pretended\nmisconduct hanging over her head; \"it is I who should tell him, is it\nnot? Well then I will write to him, and my letter shall pass through\nyour hands.\"\n\n\"But his grief--his anger, perhaps--have you thought of that?\"\n\n\"Madame, let me go away!\" replied Caroline, desperately, for the thought\nof this grief touched her heart. \"I did not come here to suffer in this\nway. I was brought here without even being told that you had sons. Let\nme leave you without trouble as well as without blame. I will never see\nM. de Villemer again; this is all I can promise. If he should follow\nme--\"\n\n\"Do not doubt that he will! For Heaven\'s sake, speak lower! What if any\none should hear you! In case he should follow you, what would you do?\"\n\n\"I shall go where he cannot follow me. Permit me to arrange this\naccording to my own judgment. In an hour I will return to take leave of\nyou, Madame de Villemer.\"\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nMlle de Saint-Geneix went out with such energetic resolution that Madame\nde Villemer dared not say another word to detain her. She saw that\nCaroline was irritated and hurt. She blamed herself for having made it\ntoo evident that \"she knew all,\" while the poor woman actually knew\nnothing, for she did not perceive Caroline\'s real affection.\n\nSo far was she from this that she tried to persuade herself Caroline had\nalways loved the Duke, that she had sacrificed herself to his happiness,\nor that, perhaps, like a practical girl, she was counting upon the\nreturn of his friendship after the honeymoon of his marriage. \"In the\nlatter case,\" thought the Marchioness, \"it would be dangerous to let her\nremain in the house. Some time or other it would bring unhappiness into\nmy young household; but it is too soon to have her go away--and so\nabruptly: the Marquis would be almost insane. She will grow calm, lay\nher plans, and whenever she returns with them I will persuade her to\naccommodate herself to mine.\"\n\nFor an hour, then, the Marchioness was engaged upon her own plans. She\nwould see her son again that evening, as had been agreed, and would tell\nhim that she had sounded Caroline\'s inclinations, and found her very\ncold toward him. For several days she would avoid the decisive\nexplanation. She would gain time, she would induce Caroline herself to\ndiscourage him, but gently and with prudence. In a word she was planning\nto control the fates, when she saw the hour had passed and Caroline had\nfailed to come. She inquired for her. She was told that Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix had gone away in a hackney-coach with a very small bundle,\nleaving behind the following letter:--\n\n\n\"MADAME DE VILLEMER,--\n\n\"I have just received the sad news that one of my sister\'s children is\nseriously ill. Pardon me for hastening to her at once without having\nasked your leave; you have visitors. Besides, I know how kind you are;\nyou will surely give me twenty-four hours. I shall be back by to-morrow\nevening. Receive the assurance of my tender and profound regard.\n\n\nCAROLINE.\"\n\n\n\"Well now, that is admirable!\" said the Marchioness to herself after a\nmoment of surprise and fright. \"She enters into my ideas; she has\nenabled me to win the first evening, the hardest of all certainly. By\npromising to come back to-morrow night she keeps my son from rushing\naway to Étampes. To-morrow probably she will have a new pretext for not\nreturning--But I would rather not know what she means to do. I shall\nthen be sure that the Marquis will never get the truth from me.\"\n\nNevertheless, the evening came too soon for her comfort. Her fears\nincreased as she saw the hour approaching when they would have to dine\ntogether.\n\nIf Caroline had really fled a little farther than Étampes, it was\nnecessary to gain time. She then decided upon telling an untruth. She\nnever spoke to her son until they were just seating themselves at table,\ncontriving to keep herself surrounded by others. It was a great dinner,\nvery ceremonious; but unable to bear the anxious gaze which he fastened\nupon her, before taking her seat she said to the young Duchess, in such\na way as to be overheard by the Marquis, \"Mlle de Saint-Geneix will not\ncome to dinner. She has a little niece ill at the convent, and has asked\nleave to go and see her.\"\n\nImmediately after dinner the Marquis, tortured with anxiety, tried to\nspeak to his mother. She avoided him again; but, seeing him preparing to\ngo out, she made signs for him to come near and whispered to him: \"She\nhas n\'t gone to the convent, but to Étampes.\"\n\n\"Then why did n\'t you tell us so awhile ago?\"\n\n\"I was mistaken. I had scarcely read the note, which was just given me\nthis evening. It is not the little girl who is mentioned, but another of\nthe children; however, she will return to-morrow morning. Come! there is\nnothing alarming in this. Be careful, my son, your bewildered face\nastonishes every one. There are ill-disposed persons everywhere: what if\nsome one should happen to think and say that you were envious of your\nbrother\'s happiness! It is known that at first it was you--\"\n\n\"Ah! mother, that is the very thing! You are keeping something from me.\nIt is Caroline who is ill. She is here, I am sure of it. Let me inquire\non your behalf--\"\n\n\"Do you want to compromise her, then? That would be no way to prepossess\nher in your favor.\"\n\n\"She is not well disposed toward me, then? Mother, you have spoken to\nher.\"\n\n\"No, I have n\'t seen her; she went away this morning.\"\n\n\"You said the note came this evening.\"\n\n\"I received it--some time, I can\'t tell when; but these questions are\nnot very amiable, my son. Pray be calm; we are observed.\"\n\nThe poor mother did not know how to tell a lie. Her son\'s anguish\npierced her to the heart. She struggled for an hour against the sight.\nEvery time he approached a door, she followed him with a glance which\nplainly told of her fear that he would go: their eyes would meet, and\nthe Marquis would remain, as if held by his mother\'s anxiety. She could\nnot bear this long. She was broken down by the fatigue of the emotions\nshe had endured for twenty-four hours; by the excitement of the\nfestivity which, for several days, she had been trying to enliven with\nall her cleverness; and above all, by the violent effort she had made\nsince dinner, to appear calm. She had herself conducted back to her own\napartment, and there fainted in the arms of the Marquis, who had\nfollowed her.\n\nUrbain lavished the most tender care on his mother, reproaching himself\na thousand times for having agitated her; assuring her that he was\ncomposed, that he would not ask another question until she had\nrecovered. He watched over her the whole night. The next day, finding\nher perfectly well, he ventured upon a few timid questions. She showed\nhim Caroline\'s note, and he waited patiently until evening. The evening\nbrought a fresh note, dated at Étampes. The child was better, but still\nso poorly that Madame Heudebert desired to keep Caroline twenty-four\nhours longer.\n\nThe Marquis promised to be patient for twenty-four hours more; but the\nnext day, deceiving his mother with the pretence of going to ride with\nhis brother and sister, he set out for Étampes.\n\nThere he learned that Caroline had really been with her sister, but had\njust set out again for Paris. They must have passed each other on the\nway. It occurred to the Marquis that on his arrival, which was evidently\nanticipated, one of the children was kept out of sight, and silence\nenjoined upon the others. He inquired after the little invalid, and\nasked to see him. Camille replied that he was asleep and she was afraid\nto wake him. M. de Villemer dared not urge the matter, and returned to\nParis seriously doubting Madame Heudebert\'s sincerity, and wholly unable\nto explain her embarrassed and absent-minded ways.\n\nHe hastened to his mother\'s; but Caroline had not made her reappearance;\nshe was perhaps at the convent. He went there to wait for her before the\niron grate, and at the close of an hour he made up his mind to ask for\nher in the name of Madame de Villemer. He was told that she had not been\nseen there for the last five days. He returned a second time to the\nHôtel de Xaintrailles; he awaited the evening; his mother still seemed\nill, and he controlled himself. But on the morrow his courage finally\nbroke down, and he sobbed at her feet, begging her to restore Caroline,\nwhom he still believed hidden in the convent by her orders.\n\nMadame de Villemer really knew nothing further about it. She began to\nshare her son\'s uneasiness. However, Caroline had taken with her only a\nvery small bundle of clothing; she could have had but little money, for\nshe was in the habit of sending it all, as soon as she received it, to\nher family. She had left her jewels and her books behind; so she could\nnot be very far off.\n\nWhile the Marquis was returning to the convent with a letter from his\nmother, who, overcome by his grief, was now really anxious to have him\nfind Caroline again,--the young lady, wrapped up and veiled to her chin,\nwas alighting from a diligence just arrived from Brioude, and, carrying\nher own bundle, was making her way alone along the picturesque boulevard\nof the town of Le Puy in Velay, toward the station of another little\nstage-coach, which was just then setting out for Issingeaux.\n\nNo one saw her face or thought of troubling himself to do so. She asked\nno questions, and seemed thoroughly acquainted with the country, its\ncustoms, and its localities.\n\nNevertheless, she was there for the first time; but, resolute, active,\nand cautious, she had before leaving Paris bought a guide-book, with a\nplan of the town and the surrounding country, which she had carefully\nstudied on the way. She then got into the diligence for Issingeaux,\ntelling the driver she would stop at Brives, that is, at about a league\nfrom Le Puy. There she alighted at the bridge of the Loire, and\ndisappeared, without asking her way of any one. She knew she had to\nfollow the Loire until it met the Gâgne; then, directing her course\ntoward the Red Rock, again follow the bed of the torrent flowing at its\nfoot until she reached the first village. There could be no possible\nmistake. There were about three leagues to be traversed on foot in a\nwilderness, and it was midnight; but the road was smooth, and the moon\ncame out clearly in a beautiful half-globe from among the great white\nclouds, driven back to the horizon by the winds of May.\n\nWhere, then, was Mlle de Saint-Geneix going in this fashion, in the\ndepths of the night and the wilds of the mountain, through a bewildering\ncountry? Has it been forgotten that she had here, in the village of\nLantriac, devoted friends and the safest of all retreats? Her nurse, the\ngood-wife Peyraque, formerly Justine Lanion, had written her a second\nletter, about six weeks before, and Caroline, remembering with certainty\nthat she had never mentioned to the Marquis or to any one of the family\nthese letters, or these people, or this country, had accepted the stern\nsuggestion of going there for a month or so, thus making sure that all\ntraces of herself would be entirely lost. Thence arose her precautions\nagainst being recognized on the way, and against exciting chance\ncuriosity by asking questions.\n\nShe had gone to Étampes to embrace her sister, and, after having told\nher all and intrusted her with all, except the secret feelings which\ndisturbed her, she had burned her ships behind her by leaving a letter\nwhich, at the end of the week, was to be forwarded to Madame de\nVillemer. In this letter she announced that she had gone abroad,\npretending to have found employment there, and begging that no anxiety\nshould be felt on her account.\n\nCumbered with her bundle, she was planning to leave it at the first\nhouse where she could effect an entrance, when she became aware of a\ntrain of ox-teams coming behind her. She waited for it. A family of\nteamsters, young and old, with a woman holding a child asleep under her\ncape, were transporting some great hewn logs,--intended to serve as\ncarpenters\' timber,--by means of a pair of solid little wheels, bound\nwith ropes to each end of the log. There were six of these logs, each\ndrawn by a yoke of oxen with a driver walking beside them. It was a\ncaravan, which occupied a long space on the road.\n\n\"Providence,\" thought Caroline, \"always helps those who rely upon it.\nHere are carriages to choose from if I am weary.\"\n\nShe spoke to the first teamster. He shook his head: he understood only\nthe dialect of the country. The second stopped, made her repeat her\nwords, then shrugged his shoulders and resumed his walk: he understood\nno better than the first. A third made signs for her to address his\nwife, who was seated on one of the logs, her feet supported by a rope.\nCaroline asked her, as she walked along, if they were going in the\ndirection of Laussonne. She did not wish to mention the name of\nLantriac, which was nearer, on the same road. The woman replied in\nFrench of very harsh accent, that they were going to Laussonne, and that\nit was \"far off,--yes, indeed!\"\n\n\"Will you let me fasten my bundle to one of these logs?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n\"Is this a refusal?\" returned Caroline. \"I do not ask it for nothing; I\nwill pay you.\"\n\nThe same response came. In Caroline\'s speech the mountaineer had\nunderstood only the name of Laussonne.\n\nCaroline knew nothing of the dialect of the Cévennes. It had formed no\npart of the early education she had received from her nurse. The music\nof Justine\'s accent, however, had lingered in her memory, and she caught\nat the bright idea of imitating it, which she succeeded in doing so well\nthat the ears of the peasant woman opened at once. She understood French\nmeasured out in this way, and even spoke it herself quite readily.\n\n\"Sit down there, behind, on the next log,\" said she, \"and give your\nbundle to my husband. Come! we ask nothing for this, my daughter.\"\n\nCaroline thanked her and took a seat upon the log. The peasant made her\na stirrup like that which held up the feet of his wife, and the rustic\nprocession went on its way but slightly delayed by the ceremony. The\nhusband, who walked close at hand, made no attempt to talk. The Cévenol\nis grave, and if he is ever curious, he will not deign to let the fact\nappear. He contents himself with listening afterward to the comments of\nthe women, who ask information boldly; but the logs were long, and\nCaroline was too far from the female mountaineer to be in danger of any\ncross-questioning.\n\nShe thus passed at no great distance the Red Rock, which she mistook at\nfirst for an enormous ruined tower; but she recalled the stories of\nJustine about this curiosity of her country, and recognized the strange\ndike, the indestructible volcanic monument, through whose pale shadow\ncast by the moon she was now journeying.\n\nThe narrow, winding road rose above the torrent little by little,\ngrowing so contracted that Caroline was frightened to see her feet\nhanging in space over these awful depths. The wheels cut down into the\nearth soaked by the rains on the extreme edge of the dizzy slope; but\nthe little oxen never swerved in the least; the driver kept on singing,\nstanding a little way off when he could find no comfortable place near\nhis log, and the nurse had a fashion of swaying back and forth that\nseemed to mask a vain struggle with sleep.\n\n\"Bless me!\" cried Caroline to the husband, \"have you no fear for your\nwife and child?\"\n\nHe understood the gesture, if not the words, and called out to his wife\nnot to drop the little one, then launched forth anew in a dismal air,\nwhich resembled a religious chant.\n\nCaroline soon became used to the dizziness; she would not be tempted\ninto turning her back to the precipice, as the peasant motioned for her\nto do. The country was so fine and so strange, the splendor of the moon\nmade it look so terrible, that she was unwilling to lose anything of the\nnovel spectacle. In the angles of the ascent, when the oxen had turned\nthe fore wheels, and the log still held the hind wheels to their former\ncourse until they threatened to go over the brink, the astonished\ntraveller unconsciously stiffened herself up a little on her stirrup of\nrope. Then the driver would speak to his oxen in a calm and gentle tone,\nand his voice, which seemed to adapt their docile steps to the least\nunevenness of the ground, reassured Caroline as if it had been the voice\nof a mysterious spirit shaping her destiny.\n\n\"And yet why should I be afraid?\" she asked herself. \"Why should I cling\nto a life which will be henceforth full of dread?--to a succession of\ndays which in prospect are a hundred times more frightful than death! If\nI fell into this chasm, I should be instantly crushed. And even if I\nsuffered an hour or two before my death, what would that be compared\nwith the years of sorrow, loneliness, and perhaps despair, which await\nme!\"\n\nWe see that Caroline at last had owned to her love and her grief. Their\nfull extent she had not yet measured, and, as she thought about that\ninstinctive love of life which had just made her shudder, bold as she\nwas by nature, she tried to persuade herself that it was a\npresentiment,--a celestial promise of speedy relief. \"Who knows! Perhaps\nI shall forget sooner than I think. Have I any right to wish for death!\nCan I even afford to give way to grief, and waste my strength! Can my\nsister and her children do without me? Do I want them to live on the\ncharity of those who have driven me away? Must I not soon go to work\nagain, and, in order to work, shall I not be obliged to forget\neverything that is not work?\"\n\nAnd then she was troubled even by her own courage. \"What,\" she said to\nherself again,--\"what if this were only a snare of hope!\" Some of M. de\nVillemer\'s words came back to her, and certain phrases in his book that\nshowed a wonderful amount of energy, penetration, and perseverance.\nWould such a man give up a plan he was bent upon, allowing himself to be\ndeceived by stratagem, and would he not have in its highest power that\ndivining sense which is a part of love!\n\n\"I have acted to no purpose; he will find me again, if he tries to find\nme. It is useless for me to have come here, though I am a hundred and\nfifty leagues off, and though it seems impossible for any one to think\nof my being here rather than elsewhere; for he will have that gift of\nsecond sight, if he loves me with all his strength. So it would be\nchildish to run away and hide, if this were the whole of my defensive\nresistance. My heart must take up arms against him, and at any moment,\nno matter when, I must stand ready to face him, and say to him, \'Suffer\nin vain or die if need be; I do not love you!\'\"\n\nAs she said this, Caroline was seized by a sudden impulse to lean\nforward, quit the stirrup, and let herself fall into the abyss. At last,\nfatigue overcame her excitement; the road, which still led upward, was\nnot so steep, and had turned away from the cleft of the ravine, leaving\nall danger behind. Their slow progress, the monotonous swaying of the\nlog, and the regular grinding of the yokes against the pole, had a\nquieting effect upon her. She watched the rocks as they passed slowly\nbefore her, under their fantastic lights, and the tree-tops, whose\nbudding leafage resembled transparent clouds. It became quite cold as\nthey rose above the valleys, and the keen air was benumbing. The torrent\nvanished into the depths, but its strong, fresh voice filled the night\nwith wild harmonies. Caroline felt her eyelids growing heavy. Judging it\ncould not be far from Lantriac, and not wanting to be carried to\nLaussonne, she jumped to the ground and walked on to rouse herself.\n\nShe knew Lantriac was in a mountain gorge and that she would be very\nnear it when she had lost sight of the torrent of the Gâgne. At the end\nof a half-hour\'s walk, in fact, she saw the outlines of houses above the\nrocks, reclaimed her bundle, made the peasant take some money, though\nnot without difficulty, evaded the curiosity of his wife, and stayed\nbehind to let them pass through the village, exposed to the barking of\nthe dogs and disturbing the rest of the villagers whom she hoped to find\nsound asleep again on her own arrival.\n\nBut nothing disturbs the sleep of the dwellers in a Velay hamlet, and\nnothing awakens their dogs. The procession of timber went along; the\nteamsters still singing, the wheels rumbling heavily over the blocks of\nlava which, under pretext of paving the streets, in these inhospitable\nvillages, form a system of defence far more impassably sure than the\nperilous roads by which you arrive.\n\nCaroline, noticing the deep silence which followed upon the noise of the\nwheels, ventured resolutely into the narrow and almost perpendicular\nstreet which was supposed to continue the highway. Here her knowledge of\nthe place came to a sudden stop. Justine had never described the\nposition of her house. The traveller, wishing to glide in quietly and\narrange with the family to keep her incognito, resolved to avoid\nknocking anywhere or waking any one, and to wait for day, which could\nnot be long in dawning. She laid her bundle down beside her on a wooden\nbench, and took her seat under the pent-house of the first cottage she\ncame to. She gazed at the queer fantastic picture made by the roofs,\nbrought into uneven and hard relief against the white clouds of the sky.\nThe moon passed into the narrow zone left open between the neighboring\npent-houses. The basin of a little fountain caught the clear moonlight\nin full, and a quarter of its circle sparkled under the fall of a\nslender spray of water from the rock. The peaceful aspect and continuous\nmeasured sound of this silvery water soon lulled our exhausted traveller\nto sleep.\n\n\"Here is certainly a change within three days,\" said she to herself,\nplacing her bundle so as to make it a rest for her weary head. \"Only\nlast Thursday, nevertheless, Mlle de Saint-Geneix, in a dress of tulle,\nher neck and arms loaded with rare pearls, and her hair full of\ncamellias, was dancing with the Marquis de Villemer, under the light of\ncountless tapers, in one of the richest of Parisian drawing-rooms. What\nwould M. de Villemer say now if he could see this pretended queen of the\nball-room, wrapped in coarse woollen, lying at the door of a shed, her\nfeet almost in the flowing water and her hands stiff with the cold?\nHappily the moon is beautiful,--and here it is striking two o\'clock!\nWell, there is an hour more to be spent here, and since sleep will come\nwhether or no, why, then, let it be welcome.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nAt daybreak Mlle de Saint-Geneix was awakened by the hens clucking and\nscratching around her. She rose and walked on, looking at the doors of\nthe houses as they opened one by one, and saying to herself with reason\nthat in a hamlet so small and stowed so close among the rocks, she could\nnot stray far without finding the face she sought.\n\nBut here a difficulty presented itself. Was she sure of recognizing this\nnurse, whom she had never seen since she was ten years old? She had\nJustine\'s voice and accent in her memory far more clearly than her face.\nShe followed the ups and downs of the road as far as the last house\nbehind the rock, and there she saw written on the door \"Peyraque\nLanion.\" A horseshoe nailed over this sign indicated his occupation of\nfarrier.\n\nJustine had risen first, as was her custom, while the closed calico\ncurtains of the bed shaded the last nap of M. Peyraque. The principal\napartment on this ground-floor showed the comfort of a well-to-do\nhousehold, and the mark of this easy competence consisted particularly\nin the garniture of the ceiling; which was trellised with racks of\nmonumental supplies of vegetables and divers rural commodities; but the\nstrict cleanliness, a rare deviation from the customs of the country,\nremoved everything which might offend the eye or the sense of smell.\n\nJustine was lighting her fire, and preparing to make the soup her\nhusband was to find smoking hot on his awakening, when she saw Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix come in with her hood on, carrying her bundle. She cast a\nlook of perplexity upon the stranger, and said at last, \"What have you\nto sell?\"\n\nCaroline, hearing Peyraque snore behind his curtain, put her finger to\nher lips and threw her hood back on her shoulders. Justine stood still\nan instant, suppressed a cry of joy, and opened her stout arms with\nrapture. She had recognized her child. \"Come, come!\" said she, leading\nher toward a little break-neck staircase at the farther end of the\nentry, \"your room is all ready. We have been hoping for you every day\nthis year.\" And she called to her husband, \"Get up, Peyraque, at once,\nand shut the door. Here is news, O, such good news!\"\n\nThe little chamber, whitewashed and furnished in rustic fashion, was,\nlike the lower room, of irreproachable neatness. The view was\nmagnificent; and blossoming fruit-trees came up to the level of the\nwindow. \"It is a paradise!\" exclaimed Caroline to the good woman. \"It\nonly needs a little fire, which you are going to make for me. I am cold\nand hungry, but happy to see you and be with you. I must tell you\nsomething, first of all. I don\'t want it known here who I am. My reasons\nare good ones, and you shall know them; they will meet your approval.\nLet us begin by agreeing on our facts; you have lived at Brioude?\"\n\n\"Yes; I was in service there before I was married.\"\n\n\"Brioude is a long way from here. Is there any one from that country in\nLantriac?\"\n\n\"No one; and strangers never come. There is no road except for\nox-carts.\"\n\n\"I saw that myself. Then you can pass me off for some one you knew at\nBrioude?\"\n\n\"Very easily,--the daughter of my old mistress.\"\n\n\"No; I\'m not to be a young lady.\"\n\n\"But she was not a young lady; she was a little tradeswoman.\"\n\n\"That\'s it; but I must have an occupation.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!--that\'s easy enough. Be a pedler of small wares, like\nthe one I am speaking of.\"\n\n\"But then I shall have to sell something.\"\n\n\"I\'ll see to that. Besides, you are supposed to have made your rounds,\nand I shall have detained you here as a matter of friendship; for you\nare going to stay?\"\n\n\"A month, at least.\"\n\n\"You must stay always. We will find you something to do, never fear.\nBut, let\'s see; what shall be your name?\"\n\n\"Charlette; you called me that when I was a little thing; so it will not\ngive you any trouble. I am supposed to be a widow, and you must say\n\'thou\' to me.\"\n\n\"Just as I used to. Good! it is agreed. But how will you dress, my dear\nCharlette?\"\n\n\"Like this. You see it\'s not luxurious.\"\n\n\"It\'s not very rich, to be sure; though it will pass; but this lovely\nblond hair of yours will attract the eye; and a city bonnet will be a\nwonder.\"\n\n\"I thought of that; so I bought at Brioude one of the head-dresses worn\nthere. I have it in my travelling-bag, and I\'m going to don my costume\nat once for fear of a surprise.\"\n\n\"Then I\'ll go at once and get you some breakfast. You will eat with\nPeyraque, I take it?\"\n\n\"And with you, I hope. To-morrow I mean to help you about the house and\nin the kitchen.\"\n\n\"O, you may pretend to do that! I don\'t want you to spoil those little\nhands I used to take such care of. Now I\'m going to see if Peyraque is\nup, and let him know what has been agreed upon; then you must tell us\nwhy there is need of all this mystery.\"\n\nWhile talking, Justine had kindled the wood already in the fireplace.\nShe had filled the pitchers with pure cold water, which had trickled\nfrom the rock, coming through an earthen pipe to the toilet-table of her\nlittle chamber, and then down into the kitchen sink. This was an\ninvention of Peyraque\'s, who prided himself oh having ideas of his own.\n\nHalf an hour afterward Caroline, whose simple attire marked no\nparticular station, put up her fine hair under the little head-dress\nfrom Brioude, less scantily contrived, and more prettily curved than the\nround dish-cover--which, like it, is of black felt trimmed with\nvelvet--worn by the women of Velay. It was all in vain; she was still\ncharming in spite of the weariness that dimmed the large eyes \"green\nlike the sea,\" formerly so bepraised by the Marchioness.\n\nThe soup of rice and potatoes was quickly served in a small room where\nPeyraque at odd moments did a little carpenter-work. The good man\nthought this an unsuitable reception, and wanted to sweep away the\nshavings. \"On the contrary,\" said his wife, spreading the chips and\nsawdust over the floor, \"you don\'t understand at all! She will think it\na pretty carpet. O you don\'t know her yet! She is a daughter of the good\nProvidence, this one is!\"\n\nCaroline made acquaintance with Peyraque by embracing him. He was a man\nof about sixty years, still very robust though thin, of medium height,\nand plain-featured, like most of the mountaineers in this region; but\nthat his austere and even stern countenance bore the stamp of integrity\nwas evident at the first glance. His rare smile was remarkably genial.\nYou saw in it real affection and sincerity, which were all the more\nunmistakable from the fact that they were never lavished\ndemonstratively.\n\nJustine also had rigid features, and a blunt way of speaking. She was a\nstrong generous character. An earnest Roman Catholic, she respected the\nsilence of her husband who was of Protestant descent, nominally\nconverted indeed, but a free-thinker if there ever was one. Caroline\nknew these circumstances and was touched to see the delicate respect\nwhich this superior woman knew how to weave into her love for her\nhusband. It must be remembered that Mlle de Saint-Geneix, the daughter\nof a very weak man, and the sister of an inefficient woman, owed the\ngreat courage she possessed first to her mother, who was of Cévenol\nparentage, and afterward to the ideas Justine had given her in early\nlife. She perceived this very clearly when she found herself seated\nbetween this old couple whose precise language and notions caused her\nneither fear nor surprise. It seemed as if the milk of her mountain\nnurse had passed into her whole being, and as if she were there in the\npresence of types with which she had already been made familiar in some\nprevious existence.\n\n\"My friends,\" said she, when Justine had brought her the cream of the\ndessert, while Peyraque washed down his soup with a draught of hot wine,\nfollowed up before long with a draught of black coffee, \"I promised to\ntell you my story and here it is in few words. One of the sons of my old\nlady had some idea of marrying me.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! that might well be,\" said Justine.\n\n\"You are right, because our characters and ideas are alike. Any one\nought to have foreseen that, and I myself first of all.\"\n\n\"And the mother, too!\" said Peyraque.\n\n\"Well, no one seems to have thought of it; and the son surprised and\neven angered the mother when he told her he loved me.\"\n\n\"And you?\" asked Justine.\n\n\"I--I--why he never told me of it at all; and, as I knew I was not noble\nenough or wealthy enough for him, I should never have allowed him to\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that\'s right!\" returned Peyraque.\n\n\"And it\'s true!\" added Justine.\n\n\"Then I saw I could not stay a day longer, and at the first angry word\nfrom the mother I went away without seeing the son again; but the son\nwould have hurried after me if I had remained with my sister. The\nMarchioness wanted me to stay a little to have an explanation with him,\nto tell him I did not love him--\"\n\n\"That is what ought to have been done, perhaps,\" said Peyraque.\n\nCaroline was forcibly impressed by the austere logic of the peasant.\n\"Yes, unquestionably,\" thought she, \"my courage ought to have been\npushed thus far.\"\n\nAnd, as she still kept silence, the nurse, enlightened by the\npenetration of a loving heart, said to her husband, sharply, \"Stop\ntalking there, you! How you run on! How do you know she did n\'t love\nhim, this poor child?\"\n\n\"Ah! that, that is another thing,\" replied Peyraque, bowing his serious,\nthoughtful head, which now looked nobler for the sense of delicate pity\nexpressed upon his face.\n\nCaroline was touched in an unspeakable degree by the straightforwardness\nof this simple friendship, which with one word touched the sorest spot\nin her wound. What she had not had strength or confidence to tell her\nsister, she was impelled not to disguise from these hearts, so\nthoroughly true and so able to read her own. \"Well, my friends, you are\nright,\" said she, taking their hands. \"I should not perhaps have been\nable to lie to you, for, in spite of myself, I--I do love him!\"\n\nHardly had she spoken the words, when she was seized with terror, and\nlooked around as if Urbain might have been there to hear them; then she\nburst into tears at the thought that he never would hear them.\n\n\"Courage, my daughter, the Lord will aid you,\" exclaimed Peyraque,\nrising.\n\n\"And we will aid you, too,\" said Justine, embracing her. \"We will hide\nyou, we will love you, we will pray for you!\"\n\nShe led her back to her room, undressed her, and made her lie down, with\nmotherly care that she should be warm and not see the sun shining in too\nearly on her bed. Then she went down to apprise her neighbors of the\narrival from Brioude of a person named Charlette, to answer all their\nquestions, mentioning her paleness and her beauty that these might not\nstrike them too forcibly. She took pains to tell them also that the\nspeech of Brioude was not at all like that of the mountains, so\nCharlette would be unable to talk with them. \"Ah! the poor creature,\"\nreplied the gossips. \"She will find it very dull and tiresome with us!\"\n\nA week later, after having informed her sister, in the proper time and\nplace, of her safe arrival, Caroline gave her some detailed account of\nher new mode of life. It must not be forgotten that, hiding her actual\nsorrow, she was trying to reassure her sister, and to divert her own\nthoughts by affecting an independence far from being so complete or so\nreal as it seemed.\n\n\"You can form no idea of the care they take of me, these Peyraques.\nJustine is always the same noble woman, with a heart like an angel\'s,\nwhom you know, and whom our father could not bear to see going away from\nus. So it is saying more than a little to declare that her husband is\nworthy of her. He has even more intelligence, although he is slower of\ncomprehension; but what he does understand is as if engraved on marble\nwithout spot or blemish. I assure you I am not weary a single moment\nwith them. I could be alone much more than I am, for my little room is\nfree from all intrusion of servants, and I can dream without being\ndisturbed; but I rarely feel the need of this: I am contented among\nthese worthy people, I am conscious of being loved.\n\n\"They have, besides, something of intellectual life, like most of the\npeople here. They inquire about things in the world without; and it is\nastonishing to find in a kind of blind alley, among such wild mountains,\na peasantry with so many notions foreign to their own necessities and\nhabits. Their children, their neighbors, and their friends impress me as\nactive, intelligent, and honest, while Peyraque tells me it is the same\nin villages farther still from all civilization.\n\n\"As an offset to this, the dwellers in the little groups of cottages\nscattered over the mountain, those who are only peasants, shepherds, or\nlaborers, live in an apathy beyond all comprehension. The other day I\nasked a woman the name of a river which formed a magnificent cascade not\nmore than a hundred paces from her house. \'That is water,\' she replied.\n\'But the water has a name, has n\'t it?\' \'I will ask my husband; I don\'t\nknow myself; we women always call all the rivers water.\'\n\n\"The husband knew enough to tell me the names of the torrent and the\ncascade; but when I asked for those of the mountains on the horizon, he\nsaid he knew nothing about them, he had never been there. \'But you must\nhave heard that those are the Cévennes?\'\n\n\"\'Perhaps so! The Mézenc and the Gerbier de Joncs [sheaf or stack of\nreeds] are over there, but I don\'t know which they are.\'\n\n\"I pointed them out to him; they are easily recognized,--Mézenc, the\nloftiest of the peaks, and the Gerbier, an elegant cone, which holds in\nits crater reeds and swamp-grasses. Only, the good man would not even\nlook. It was all precisely the same to him. He showed me the \'grottos of\nthe ancient savages,\' that is, a kind of Gallic or Celtic village\nhollowed out of the rock, with the same precautions that beasts of the\nwilderness use to conceal their dens; for you can examine this rock and\nfollow it without discovering anything unusual unless you know the path\nwhich penetrates this labyrinth and its habitations. Ah, my dear\nCamille, am I not here a little like those \'ancient savages,\' who, for\nfear of intrusion, hid themselves in caves and sought their peace in\nforgetfulness of the whole world?\n\n\"At all events, the inhabitants of La Roche impress me as being the\ndirect descendants of those poor Celts, hidden in their rock, and, as it\nwere, bound to it. I looked at the woman, with bare legs and dull eyes,\nwho conducted us into the grottos, and asked myself whether three or\nfour thousand years had really passed away since her ancestors took root\nin these stones.\n\n\"You see I go out, for prudence does not require the in-door life, which\nyou feared for me. On the contrary, having nothing to read here, I feel\nthe need of strolling about, and my movements surprise the good people\nof Lantriac much less than a mysterious retreat would do. I run no risk\nof meeting strangers. You saw me set out in clothing that would not\nattract attention in the least. Besides, I have a black felt hat, larger\nthan those worn here, which shades my face quite nicely. In case of\nneed, too, I can conceal it entirely under the brown hood I brought with\nme, which the capricious weather gives me an excuse for wearing in my\nwalks. I am not just like the women of the country; but there is nothing\nin my appearance to create a sensation in the places where I go.\n\n\"Then, too, I have a pretext for going out, which accounts for\neverything. Justine has a little trade in small wares and gives me\ncharge of a box whose contents I offer for sale, while Peyraque, who is\na farrier, busies himself with visiting sick animals. This enables me to\ngo into the houses and observe the manners and customs of the country. I\nsell but little, for the women are so absorbed in their lace-making that\nthey never mend for their husbands, their children, or themselves. Here\nis the triumph of rags worn with pride. Their devotion to their one\noccupation is so passionate as to exclude all material well-being and\nall cleanliness even, as a profane superfluity. Avarice finds its\naccount in this, and vanity also, for if Justine gave me jewelry to sell\nI should soon have customers more eager for that than for linen and\nshoes.\n\n\"They produce all those marvellous black and white laces, which you have\nseen Justine make at our house. It is wonderful to see, here among the\nmountains, this fairy-like work coming from the hands of these poor\ncreatures, and the trifling sum they realize shocks the traveller. They\nwould cheerfully give you for twenty sous what they ask twenty francs\nfor in Paris, if they were allowed to trade with the consumer; but this\nis strictly forbidden. Under the pretext of having furnished silk,\nthread, and patterns, the dealer monopolizes and sets a price on their\nwork. In vain you offer to supply the peasant-woman with materials and\npay her well. The poor woman sighs, looks at the money, shakes her head,\nand replies that she will not risk losing the patronage of \'her master\'\nin order to profit by the liberality of a person who will not employ her\npermanently, and whom she may possibly never see again. And then all\nthese women are pious, or pretend to be so. Those who are sincere have\nsworn by the Virgin and the saints not to sell to individuals, and one\nis forced to honor their respect for a promise given. Those who make\nreligion a regular profession (and I see there are more such than one\nwould suppose) are conscious of being always under the hand and beneath\nthe eye of the priests, nuns, monks, and seminarists, with whom this\ncountry is literally sown and covered even in the most uninhabitable\nplaces. The convents have the work done; and here, as elsewhere, under\nconditions of trade still more lucrative than those of the dealers. You\ncan see, in the vestibules of the churches even, the women from the\nvillage in a sort of community, sitting in a circle, making their\nbobbins fly as they murmur litanies or chant offices in Latin; which\ndoes not, however, prevent them from gazing curiously at the passers-by\nand exchanging remarks, while they reply _ora pro nobis_ to the gray,\nblack, or blue sister who oversees the work and the psalmody.\n\n\"These women are generally kind and hospitable. Their children interest\nme, and when I find those who are ill, I am glad to be able to point out\nthe more simple attentions that should be given them. There is either\ngreat ignorance or great indifference on this point. Maternity here is\nrather passionate than tender. It is as if they told you that children\nare created for the single purpose of learning how to suffer.\n\n\"Peyraque\'s business, as his services are much in demand, leads us into\nsome almost inaccessible places on the mountain, giving me a chance to\nsee the finest landscapes in the world, for this wonderful country is\nlike a dream,--and my own life is a strange dream also, is it not?\n\n\"Our fashion of going in search of adventures is quite primitive.\nPeyraque has a little cart, which he is pleased to denominate a\ncarriage, because it has an awning of canvas, which somewhat ambitiously\npretends to shelter us. He harnesses to this vehicle now an intrepid\nlittle mule, and now a pony, spirited but gentle, all skin and bone like\nits owner, but like him, too, never flinching at anything. So, while\nJustine\'s eldest son, just returned from the regiment, where he has been\nshoeing artillery horses, continues his trade under the paternal roof,\nhis father and I wander over hill and vale without regard to the\nweather. Justine pretends this does me so much good that I must stay\nwith her \'always,\' and vows she will find some way for me to earn our\nlivelihood without humiliating myself to serve any great lady.\n\n\"Alas! I never felt humiliated so long as I knew I was loved; and then I\nloved so sincerely in return! Do you know it saddens me no longer to\nreceive a blessing every morning from that poor old Marchioness, and not\nonly so, but I am quite uneasy, alarmed about her even, as if I felt she\ncould not live without me? God grant she may soon forget me, that my\nplace may already have been filled by one less fatal than I to her\npeace. But will she be cared for, morally speaking, as I cared for her?\nWill her fanciful whims be understood, the dulness of her leisure hours\ncharmed away, or her children spoken of as she loves to hear them spoken\nof? On my arrival here, I drank in the free air with long breaths; I\ngazed at this grand, rugged scenery which I had felt so strong a wish to\nknow. I said to myself, \'Here I am then free! I shall go where I please;\nI will talk as little as I please; I shall no longer write the same\nletter ten times a day to ten different people; I shall not live in a\nhot-house; I shall not breathe the sharp perfumes of flowers distilled\nby chemical processes, or of plants half dead on the windowsills; I\nshall drink from the breeze hawthorn and wild thyme in their real\nfragrance.\' Yes, I said all this to myself, and I could not rejoice. I\nsaw my poor friend sad and lonely, perhaps weeping for having made me\nweep so much!\n\n\"But she chose this, and to all appearance, it was necessary. I have no\nright to blame her for a moment of unjust anger. The mother thought only\nof her son, and such a son well deserves all a mother\'s sacrifice.\nPerhaps she calls me hard and ungrateful for not falling in with her\nplans, and I often ask myself if I ought not to have fallen in with\nthem; but I always answer that the end would not have been attained. The\nMarquis de V---- is not one of those men who can be sent off with a few\ncommonplaces of cool disdain. Besides, you have no right to act thus\ntoward one who, far from declaring his passion, has surrounded you with\nrespect and delicate affection. In vain I seek some language, half cold,\nhalf tender, which I might have used in telling him that I hold his\nmother\'s happiness and his own equally sacred: I do not find in myself\nthe requisite tact or skill. Either the real friendship I have for him\nwould have deceived him as to my feelings, leading him to think I was\nsacrificing myself to a sense of duty, or my firmness would have\noffended him, as if I were parading a virtue whose aid he has never\ngiven me occasion to invoke. No, no! it could not be, it ought not to\nbe.\n\n\"I have an impression that the Marchioness hinted that I might tell him\nI had an engagement, another love. For Heaven\'s sake, let her invent all\nshe will now! Let her sacrifice my life and that which I hold still more\nsacred, if need be. I have left the field clear: but, for my own part, I\ncould never have improvised a romance for the occasion. And would he\nhave been duped by it?\n\n\"Camille, you will see him, you have doubtless already seen him again\nsince that first visit, when you admitted it was hard for you to play\nyour part. You say it made you very unhappy to see him; he was almost\ndistracted--He is certainly calm now. He has so much moral strength, he\nwill understand so well that I must never see him again? However, be on\nyour guard! He is very keen. Tell him my nature is a cold one--no, not\nthat; he would n\'t believe it. But speak of my invincible pride. That is\ntrue; yes, I am proud, I feel it! And if I were not, should I deserve\nhis affection?\n\n\"Perhaps it would have been liked if I had become really unworthy of his\nregard,--not the mother; not she! no, never! She is too upright, too\npious, too pure in heart; but the Duke, I mean. Now, I can recall a\nnumber of things which I did not understand, and they appear in a new\nlight. The Duke is excellent; he worships his brother. I believe his\nwife, who is an angel, will purify his life and thoughts; but at Séval,\nwhen he told me to save his brother at any cost,--I think of it now, and\nI blush to think of it!\n\n\"Ah, that I might be allowed to disappear, that I might be allowed to\nforget all! For a year I believed myself calm, worthy, happy. One day,\none hour has spoiled the whole. With one word, Madame de Villemer has\npoisoned all the memories I had hoped to carry away unsoiled,--memories\nwhich now I dare not dwell upon. In truth, Camille, you were right in\nsaying, as you sometimes did, that one should not be too ingenuous, that\nI ventured out into life too quixotically. This will serve me as a\nlesson, and I will renounce friendship as well as love. I ask myself why\nI should not from this time onward break off all relations with a world\nso full of dangers and snares, why I should not accept my misery more\nbravely indeed than I have done. I could create some resources in this\nprovince even, remote as it is in point of civilization. I could not be\na school-mistress, as Justine imagined last year; the clergy have\nusurped everything here, and the good sisters would not let me teach,\neven in Lantriac; but in a city I could find pupils, or I could become a\nbook-keeper in some mercantile house.\n\n\"First of all, I must make sure of being forgotten there; but when this\noblivion is complete, I must indeed take thought for our children, and I\ndwell upon this a little in advance. After all, be at ease. I will find\nsomething. I shall manage to conquer the malicious fates. I do not\nsleep, I cannot falter; you know this perfectly. You have enough to live\non for two months more, and I need absolutely nothing here. Do not\nworry, let us always trust the good God, as you, for your part, must\ntrust the sister who loves you.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nCaroline had reason to be alarmed by the inquiries M. de Villemer was\nmaking at her sister\'s. He had already returned twice to Étampes, and,\nfully aware that delicacy forbade anything like a system of\ncross-questioning, he confined himself to watching the demeanor of\nCamille, and drawing his own inferences from her silent evasions.\nThenceforth he might take it for granted that Madame Heudebert knew her\nsister\'s hiding-place and that Caroline\'s disappearance gave her no real\nuneasiness. Camille held in reserve the letter which said Caroline had\nfound employment away from France, and did not produce it. She saw such\nanguish and distress in the features of the Marquis, which were already\nmuch changed, that she dared not inflict this last blow on the\nbenefactor, the protector of her children. Besides Madame Heudebert did\nnot share all Caroline\'s scruples or comprehend all her pride. She had\nnot ventured to blame her, in this regard; but she herself would not\nhave held it so great a crime to brave the displeasure of the\nMarchioness a little, and become her daughter-in-law notwithstanding.\n\"Since the intentions of the Marquis were so serious,\" thought she, \"and\nhis mother loves him so that she dares not oppose him openly, and,\nfinally, since he is of age and master of his own fortune, I don\'t see\nwhy Caroline could not have used her influence over the old lady, her\npowers of persuasion, and the evidence of her own worth, and so led her\ngently to admit the propriety of the marriage.--There! poor Caroline,\nwith all her valiant devotedness, is too romantic, and will go away and\nkill herself in order to support us; while, with a little patient tact,\nshe might be happy and make us all happy too.\"\n\nHere is another common-sense opinion which may be set over against that\nof Peyraque and Justine. Of these two lines of reasoning the reader is\nfree to adopt the one that he prefers; but the narrator must, of\nnecessity, hold an opinion also, and he avows a little partiality for\nthat of Caroline.\n\nThe Marquis perceived that Madame Heudebert made, now and then, some\ntimid allusions to the state of things, and felt sure she knew the\nwhole. He threw himself on her mercy a little more than he had done\nhitherto; and Camille, encouraged, asked him, with a sufficient want of\ntact, whether, in case the Marchioness proved inexorable, he was fully\nresolved to make Caroline an offer of his hand. She seemed on the point\nof betraying her sister\'s secret, if the Marquis would pledge his word\nof honor.\n\nThe Marquis replied without hesitation: \"If I was sure of being loved,\nif the happiness of Mlle de Saint-Geneix depended on my courage, I would\ncontrive to do away with my mother\'s prejudices, at any cost; but you\ngive me no encouragement. Only give me that, and you will see!\"\n\n\"I give you encouragement!\" exclaimed Camille, amazed and confused. She\nhesitated to reply. She had indeed divined Caroline\'s secret; but the\nlatter had always guarded it proudly, not by falsehood, but by never\nallowing herself to be questioned, and Madame Heudebert had not the\ndaring to inflict a severe wound on her sister\'s dignity, by taking it\nupon herself to compromise her. \"That is something I am no wiser about\nthan you,\" said she. \"Caroline has a strong character,--one which I\ncannot always fathom.\"\n\n\"And this strength of hers is so great,\" said the Marquis, \"that she\nwould never accept my name without my mother\'s sincere benediction. This\nI know better even than you do. So tell me nothing; it is for me alone\nto act. I ask of you only one thing more, and that is to let me watch\nover you and your children until something new shall occur, and\neven--yes, I will venture to say it--I am haunted by the fear that Mlle\nda Saint-Geneix may find herself without resources, exposed to\nprivations which it makes me shudder to think of. Spare me this dread.\nLet me leave you a sum which you can return, if there is no use for it,\nbut which, in case of need, you will remit to her as coming from\nyourself.\'\n\n\"O, that is quite impossible,\" replied Camille: \"she would divine the\nsource, and never forgive me for having taken it!\"\n\n\"I see you are really afraid of her.\"\n\n\"Just as I am of all that commands respect.\"\n\n\"Then we feel alike,\" replied the Marquis as he took leave. \"I am so\nthoroughly afraid of her that I dare not seek her any farther, and yet I\nmust find her again or die.\"\n\nShortly afterward the Marquis drew an explanation from his mother, which\nwas painful enough to both of them. Although he saw her suffering, sad,\nregretting Caroline a hundred times more than she admitted, and although\nhe had resolved to await a more propitious moment for his inquiries, the\nexplanation came, in his own despite and in despite of the Marchioness,\nthrough the fatality of circumstances. The anxiety of the situation was\ntoo intense; it could not be prolonged. Madame de Villemer confessed\nthat she had conceived a sudden prejudice against the character of Mlle\nde Saint-Geneix, and that at the very moment of fulfilling her promise\nshe had let Caroline feel the exceeding pain it caused her. Gradually,\nunder the eager questioning of the Marquis, the conversation grew more\nanimated, and Madame de Villemer, pushed to extremity, allowed the\naccusation against Caroline to escape her. The unfortunate girl had\ncommitted a fault pardonable in the eyes of the Marchioness when acting\nas her friend and guardian, but one which made it quite out of the\nquestion even to think of receiving her as a daughter.\n\nBefore this result of calumny the Marquis did not flinch one instant.\n\"It is an infamous lie,\" he cried, beside himself,--\"a base lie! And you\ncould believe it? Then it must have been very artful and very audacious.\nMother, you must tell me all, for I am not disposed to be taken in so\nmyself.\"\n\n\"No, my son, I shall tell you no more,\" replied Madame de Villemer\nfirmly; \"and every word you add to those you have just uttered, I shall\nconsider a breach of filial affection and respect.\"\n\nSo the Marchioness remained impenetrable; she had promised not to betray\nLéonie; and, besides, nothing in the world would tempt her to sow the\nseeds of discord between her two sons. The Duke had so often told her,\nin Urbain\'s presence, that he had never sought or obtained a single kind\nlook from Caroline! This, in the opinion of the Marchioness, was a\nfalsehood the Marquis would never pardon. She knew, now, that he had\ntaken the Duke into his confidence, and that Gaëtan, touched by his\ngrief, had persuaded his wife into taking measures for seeking Caroline\nin all the Parisian convents. \"He does not speak,\" said the Marchioness\nto herself; \"he will not dissuade his wife and brother from this folly,\nwhen he ought, at the very least, to have confessed the past to the\nMarquis, in order to cure him of it. It is too late now to risk such\navowals. I cannot do it without leading my two sons to kill each other\nafter having loved so warmly.\"\n\nMeanwhile Caroline wrote her sister as follows:--\n\n\"You feel alarmed because I am in so uneven and rocky a region, and ask\nwhat can be fine enough to make one run the risk of being killed at\nevery step. First of all, there is really no danger here for me under\nthe guidance of this good Peyraque. The roads, that would be actually\nfrightful, and, as I think, impassable for carriages like those with\nwhich we are familiar, are just large enough for the little carts of\nthis region. Then, too, Peyraque is very prudent. When he cannot measure\nwith his eye just precisely the space he needs, he has a method of\nascertaining it, which made me laugh heartily the first time I saw him\nput it in practice. He trusts me with the reins, jumps to the ground\nhimself, takes his whip, which has the exact size of his cart marked\nwith a little notch on its stock, and, advancing a few paces on the\nroad, he proceeds to measure the width of the passage between the rock\nand the precipice,--sometimes between one precipice on the right and\nanother on the left. If the road has a centimetre more than is needful\nhe comes back triumphant, and we go quickly by. If we have no such\ncentimetre in which to disport ourselves, he makes me alight, while he\nleads the horse by the bridle, dragging on the carriage. When we find\ntwo little walls hemming in a foot-path, we place one wheel on either\nwall and the horse in the pathway. I assure you one soon becomes\naccustomed to all this, and already I think no more about it. The horses\nhere have no vicious tricks, and are not inclined to shy; they know the\ndanger as well as we, and accidents are no more frequent in this country\nthan they are on the plains. I certainly exaggerated the danger of these\njaunts in my first letters; it was from vanity, or a lingering fear, of\nwhich I am wholly cured now that I feel it was groundless.\n\n\"As to the beauty of Velay, I could never describe it for you. I did not\ndream there could be, here in the heart of France, a country so strange\nand so imposing. It is far more lovely than Auvergne, through which I\npassed on my way hither. The city of Le Puy is probably unique in point\nof location; it is perched upon masses of lava that seem to spring up\nfrom its very heart and form a part of its architecture. These lava\npyramids are indeed the edifices of giants; but those which man has\nplaced on their sides, and often on their summits, have certainly been\ninspired by the grandeur and wildness of the spot.\n\n\"The cathedral is admirable, in the Romanesque style, of the same color\nas the rocks, but slightly enlivened by the blue and white mosaics on\nthe pediments of its façade. It is placed so as to seem colossal, for,\nto reach it, you must climb a mountain of dizzy steps. The interior is\nsublime in its elegant strength and solemn dimness. I never understood\nthe terrors of the Middle Ages, or felt them, so to speak, as I did\nunder these bare, black pillars, beneath these storm-laden domes. There\nwas a furious tempest while I was there. The flashes sent their infernal\nlights across the splendid windows that strew the walls and pavements\nwith jewels. The thunders seemed rolling forth from the sanctuary\nitself. It was Jehovah in all his wrath; but it gave me no alarm. The\ntrue God, whom we love to-day, has no menaces for the weak. I prayed\nthere with a perfect faith, and felt it had done me good. As for these\nbeautiful temples of the faith in ages both rude and stern, it is clear\nthey are the expression of the one grand word, \'mystery,\' whose veil it\nwas forbidden to lift. If M. de Villemer had been there he would have\nsaid--\n\n\"But a course of history and religious philosophy is not to the point\nnow. The ideas of M. de Villemer are no longer the book from which I may\nstudy the past or learn to anticipate the future.\n\n\"You see, thanks to good Peyraque and his desire to show me the marvels\nof Velay, thanks also to my impenetrable hood, I have ventured into the\ncity and its suburbs. The city is everywhere picturesque; it is still a\nmediæval town, closely studded with churches and convents. The\ncathedral is flanked by a whole world of ancient structures, where,\nunder mysterious arcades, and in the turns and twists of the rock they\nstand on, you can see cloisters, gardens, staircases, and mute shadows\ngliding by, hidden beneath veil and cassock. A strange silence reigns\nthere, and a certain odor of the past, I know not what, which makes one\nshiver with fear, not of our God, the source of all confidence and\nspiritual freedom, but of everything that, in the name of God, breaks up\nforever the ties and duties of our common humanity. In our convent, I\nremember a religious life seemed cheerful; here, it is sombre enough to\nmake one tremble.\n\n\"From the cathedral you must keep going down hill for an hour to reach\nthe Faubourg d\'Aiguilhe, where another monument rears its head, which is\nnatural and historic, at one and the same time, and, indeed, the most\ncurious thing in the world. It is a volcanic sugar-loaf three hundred\nfeet in height, which you mount by a spiral stairway until you reach a\nByzantine chapel, necessarily quite small, but charming, and built, it\nis said, on the site and from the fragments of a temple to Diana.\n\n\"A legend is current here, which struck me forcibly. A young girl, a\nChristian virgin, pursued by some miscreant, flung herself to escape him\ndown from the top of the terrace; she arose at once; she was unharmed.\nThe miracle was noised abroad. She was declared a saint. Pride grew\nstrong in her heart; she promised to hurl herself down again, to show\nshe was under the protection of angels; but this time Heaven deserted\nher, and she was crushed like a vain silly creature as she was.\n\n\"Pride! yes, God leaves the proud to themselves, and without him what\ncan they do? But do not tell me that I am proud. No, it is not pride. I\nhave no desire to prove anything to any one. I ask to be forgotten, and\nthat there should be no suffering on my account.\n\n\"There is near Le Puy, forming a part of its magnificent landscape, a\nvillage that also crowns one of those singular, isolated rocks, which\nbreak through the soil here at every step. It is called Espaly, and this\nrock also bears up the ruins of a feudal castle and of Celtic grottos.\nOne of these caves is inhabited by two persons, aged and poor, whose\nsqualid misery is heart-rending. This couple live here in the solid\nrock, with a single hole for chimney and window. At night they block up\nthe door, in winter with straw; in summer, with the old woman\'s\npetticoat. A small, rude bed without coverlids or mattress, two stools,\na little iron lamp, a spinning-wheel, and two or three earthen\npots,--these are all the furniture.\n\n\"Nevertheless, only a few paces from them there is a vast and splendid\nhouse belonging to the Jesuits and named the Paradise. At the foot of\nthe rock flows a brook which brings down precious stones in its sand.\nThe old woman sold me for twenty sous a handful of garnets, sapphires,\nand jacinths, which I am keeping for Lili. The stones are too small to\nhave any actual value, but there must be a precious deposit somewhere\namong these rocks. The Jesuit fathers will find it, perhaps; I don\'t\nexpect to make the discovery myself, however; so I must think about\nprocuring some work. Peyraque has an idea which he has enlarged upon for\nthe last few days, and which was suggested to him by this very rock of\nEspaly; I will tell you how.\n\n\"While strolling about over this rock, I was taken with one of my sudden\nfancies for a little child, playing in the lap of a pretty woman from\nthe village, who was strong and cheerful. This child, you see, I can\ncompare with no one but our Charley, for inspiring affection. He does\nnot look like Charley, but has the same demure playfulness, and the shy\ncaresses which make one his willing slave. When I called upon Peyraque\nto admire him, remarking how clean he was kept, and that his mother made\nno lace, but seemed wholly taken up with him, as if she knew she had a\ntreasure there, Peyraque at once replied, \'You have come nearer the\ntruth than you thought. This child is a treasure for Dame Roqueberte. If\nyou ask who he is, she will tell you it is the child of a sister she has\nin Clermont; but this is not true: the little one has been placed in her\ncharge by a gentleman whom no one knows, who pays her for rearing it,\nwho pays her, besides, for taking great care of it, as if it were the\nson of a prince. So you see this woman is well dressed and does not\nwork. She was in easy circumstances before. Her husband has charge of\nthe castle of Polignac, whose great tower, and in fact all the ruined\nportion, you can see over yonder, on a rock larger and loftier than that\nof Espaly; that is where she lives, and, if you meet her here, it is\nbecause now she has such fine chances for pleasure strolls. The real\nmother of the little one must be dead, for she has never been heard of;\nbut the father comes to see it, leaves money, and stipulates that it\nshall not be allowed to want for anything.\'\n\n\"You see, dear sister, this is a romance. That is partly what attracted\nme perhaps, since, according to your ideas, I am quite romantic.\nCertainly this little boy has something about him which captivates the\nimagination. He is not strong; they say when he first came here he had\nhardly life enough to breathe; but now he is quite blooming, and the\nmountain air agrees with him so well that his father, who came here at\nabout this time last year to take him away, decided to leave him a year\nlonger, in order to have him regain his strength completely. The little\ncreature has an angelic face, dreamy eyes, with a far-off look in them,\nstrange in a child of his age, and there is a wondrous grace in all his\nways.\n\n\"Peyraque, seeing me so bewitched, scratched his head with an air of\nprofundity and continued, \'Well, tell me, then, since you are fond of\nlittle children, why, instead of making it your occupation to read\naloud, which must be wearisome, do you not find a little pupil like\nthat, whom you could educate at your sister\'s with the other children?\nThis would leave you in your own home and to your own ways.\'\n\n\"\'You forget, my good Peyraque, that perhaps it will be long before I\ncan go to my sister.\'\n\n\"\'Well, then, your sister might come and live here, or else you could\nstay with us for a year or two; my wife would aid you in taking care of\nthe child, and you would only have the trouble of watching over him and\nteaching him.--Stop! I have an idea of my own about this child, since\nhe pleases you so that you are doting on him already. His father will\ncome after him one of these days. Suppose I should tell him about you?\'\n\n\"\'Then you are acquainted with him!\'\n\n\"\'I acted as driver for him once, and carried him to the mountain in my\ncarriage. He seems a fine man, but too young to take upon himself the\nbringing up of a child of three years. He will have to place it in\ncharge of some woman, and he cannot leave it any longer with the\nRoqueberts, for they are not capable of teaching what a young gentleman\nlike him ought to know. This would be your own task, especially, and the\nfather would never find so good a mother for his child. Hope, hope!\n(which signifies wait!) I will keep watch at Polignac, and as soon as\nthis father arrives, I will manage to talk with him in the proper way.\'\n\n\"I let good Peyraque cultivate this project, and Justine also, but I\nhave no faith in it myself, for the mysterious personage expected will\nask questions I am unwilling to have answered, unless I am quite sure he\nknows none of the people, either intimately or remotely, from whom my\nplace of retreat must be concealed. And how could I make sure of that?\nPeyraque\'s idea is, nevertheless, in itself a good one. To educate some\nchild at home for a few years would please me infinitely better than\ngoing into a strange family again. I would rather take a girl than a\nboy, as she would be left with me a longer time; but there will be\nlittle room for choice, for these children hidden away by their parents\nare not easy to find. And there must needs be the most perfect\nconfidence in me. I must be well recommended. Madame d\'Arglade, who\nknows all the secrets of fashionable life, could find for me a chance\nlike this; but I would rather not apply to her: without intending to do\nso, she might bring upon me some fresh misfortune.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nA few days later Caroline wrote again to her sister.\n\n\n\"POLIGNAC, May 15.\n\n\"Here I have been for five days past, in one of the most imposing ruined\ncastles left from feudal times, on the summit of a great, black lava\nboulder, like those I told you about in connection with Le Puy and\nEspaly. You will think my position has changed, and my dream has become\nreality. No: I am certainly near little Didier, but I have taken it upon\nmyself to watch over him, for his father or protector has not yet\nappeared. Now see what has happened.\n\n\"I felt a wish to see the child again, besides a slight wish to learn\nmore about him; and lastly I had a desire to examine closely this castle\nof Polignac, which looks from afar like a city of giants, on a rock from\nthe infernal depths. It is the strongest mediæval fortress in the\ncountry; it was the nest of that terrible race of vultures under whose\nravages Velay, Forez, and Auvergne have trembled. The ancient lords of\nPolignac have left everywhere throughout these provinces mementos and\ntraditions worthy of the legends about the ogre and Blue-Beard. These\nfeudal tyrants robbed travellers, pillaged churches, murdered the monks,\ncarried off women, set fire to villages, and this, too, from father to\nson, through long centuries. The Marquis de Villemer worked out of these\nfacts one of the most remarkable chapters of his book; drawing the\nconclusion that the descendants of this family though innocent,\nassuredly, of the crimes of their ancestors, seem, by their misfortunes,\nto have been expiating the triumphs of barbarism.\n\n\"Their citadel was impregnable. The rock is sliced down perpendicularly\non all sides. The village forms a group below on the little hill which\nsupports the block of lava. It is some distance from Lantriac. The\ninsuperable ravines here make all distances great. Having started early,\nhowever, we arrived last Tuesday toward noon, and our little horse\ncarried us to the foot of the postern. Peyraque left me there, in order\nto take care of our animal, and to look at some others, for he has quite\na reputation in veterinary science, and wherever he goes, practice of\nthis kind always comes to him.\n\n\"I found a little girl ten years of age to open the door for me; but\nwhen I asked to see Dame Roqueberte, the child told me with tears that\nher mother was dying. I hurried to where she lives,--a part of the\ncastle still standing, in good repair,--and I found her the victim of a\nbrain-fever. Little Didier was playing about the room with another of\nthis poor woman\'s children; the latter child was quite happy,\ncomprehending nothing, although the elder; while Didier, between smiles\nand tears, was looking toward the bedside with as much anxiety as a\nlittle creature of three years could be expected to show. When he caught\nsight of me, he came to me at once, and without coquetting before\nembracing me, as he did the first time, he clung to my dress, pulling me\nwith his little hands, and saying \'mamma,\' in a voice so plaintive and\ngentle that my whole heart was won by it. He was certainly telling me\nabout the strange condition of his adopted mother. I drew near the bed.\nDame Roqueberte could not speak; she knew no one. Her husband came in\nafter a moment and began to be alarmed, for she had been in this state\nonly a few hours. I told him it was time to send for a physician and a\nwoman to take care of his wife, which he did at once; and as I could not\nbe sure that it was not typhoid fever, I sent the children out of the\nroom, warning the husband that it might be dangerous to leave them\nthere.\n\n\"When the physician came at the expiration of two hours, he approved\nwhat I had done, observing that the disease had not yet defined itself\nand that the children must be placed in some other house. This change I\nundertook to make with the help of Peyraque, for the husband had quite\nlost his senses, and thought of nothing but having candles burnt in the\nvillage church and prayers mumbled in Latin which he could not\nunderstand, but which seemed to him of more efficacy than the doctor\'s\nprescriptions.\n\n\"When he had calmed down a little it was already four o\'clock; and it\nwas necessary for Peyraque to set out again with me, that the night\nmight not overtake us in the ravine of the Gâgne. There was no moon for\nthe moment, and a storm was impending. Then poor Roquebert began to\nlament, saying that he was ruined unless some one would take care of the\nchildren, and especially of \'the child,\' meaning by that Didier,--the\nhen with the golden eggs for his household. Special care was needful for\nhim; he was not strong like the children of the country, and besides he\nwas \'curious,\' he wanted to go everywhere, and these ruins are a\nlabyrinth of precipices, where a young gentleman of this adventurous\ntemper must not be lost sight of a single moment. He dared not trust him\nwith any one. The money this little one had brought into his house had\nmade others envious, he had enemies; what did I know about it? In short,\nPeyraque said to me in a low voice, \'Come, your good heart and my own\nbright ideas are at one in this matter. Remain here; I see they have the\nwherewith to lodge you comfortably; I will come back to-morrow to see\nhow the case stands, and take you home if there is no further need of\nyou.\'\n\n\"I confess I desired this decision; it seemed as if it were a duty as\nwell as a privilege to watch over the child. Peyraque returned the next\nday, and as I saw that Dame Roqueberte, though out of danger, would not\nbe able to sit up for some days, I consented to remain, telling Peyraque\nnot to come after me till the end of the week.\n\n\"I am very comfortable here, in a vast room, which is, I believe, an old\nhall for the guards, that has been divided into several portions for the\nuse of the farmers. The beds, though very rustic, are clean, and the\nhousekeeping I attend to myself. I have the three children at my side\nall the time. The little girl does the cooking while I superintend; I\nsee to the attendance which must be given the mother; I wash and dress\nDidier myself. He is clothed like the others, in a little blue blouse,\nbut with more care, especially since I have made it my concern,--and I\nam so fond of him that I dread the moment when I shall have to leave\nhim. You know my passion for children,--that is, for some children; this\none is certainly well born. Charley would be as jealous of him as a\ntiger. Because, you see, this Didier is surely the son of a superior man\nor woman. He is of high, fine descent, morally speaking; his face is of\na somewhat dull whiteness with little flushes of color like those on\nstandard roses. He has brown eyes of admirable shape and expression, and\na forest of black hair, half inclined to curl, which is fine and soft as\nsilk. His little hands are perfect, and he never soils them. He does not\ndig in the earth, and never touches anything: he passes his life in\nlooking at things. I am sure he has thoughts beyond his years which he\ncannot express, or rather, a series of dreams, charming and divine, that\ncannot be translated into human language; yet he talks very fluently for\none of his age, both in French and patois. He has caught the accent of\nthe country, but makes it very sweet by his infantile lisp. He has the\nprettiest reasons in the world for doing as he pleases, and what he\npleases is to be out of doors, climbing over the ruins, or crawling into\ntheir crevices; once there, he sits down, gazing at the tiny flowers,\nand especially at the insects, without touching them, but following all\ntheir motions, apparently interested in these living marvels, while the\nother children think only of crushing and destroying them.\n\n\"I have tried to give him his first notions in reading, being persuaded\n(contrary to the father\'s opinion perhaps) that the earlier you begin\nwith children the more you spare them the heavy strain on the attention,\nso painful when their strength and activity have found greater\ndevelopment. I have tested his intelligence and curiosity; they are\nunusual, and with our wonderful method, which succeeded so well with\nyour children, I am sure I could teach him to read in a month.\n\n\"And then this child is all soul, and his self-will melts into boundless\naffection. Our fondness is growing too fast really, and I ask myself how\nwe are ever going to part.\n\n\"Besides, although I miss my Justine and Peyraque, I enjoy myself\nexceedingly among these magnificent ruins, commanding as they do one of\nthe loveliest spots on earth. The air is so pure that the white stones,\nmixed with rough fragments of lava, are as bright as if just from a\nquarry. And then the interior of this immense castle is stored with very\ncurious things.\n\n\"You must know that the Polignac family pretend to a descent from Apollo\nor his priests in a direct line; and that tradition consecrates the\nexistence here of a temple to this god,--a temple of which some\nfragments yet remain. As for myself, I think there is no doubt of it,\nand that just to see these fragments is enough. The question to decide\nis whether the inscriptions and carvings were brought here to decorate\nthe castle according to Renaissance usage, or whether the castle was\nbuilt upon these vestiges. Dame Roqueberte tells me the scientific men\nof the country have been disputing over it for fifty years, and for my\nown part I agree with those who think the curbstone of the well was the\nmouthpiece of the god\'s oracles. The orifice of this immense well, with\nwhich another and a smaller well grotesquely communicates, was closed by\na colossal head of noble outline, whose perforated mouth gave forth the\nsubterranean voice of the priestess. Why not? Those who say it was only\nthe mask of a fountain are no surer. The head has been preserved from\ndestruction in the lower story of a little tower, along with a pile of\nstone bullets found in the well. I have amused myself by taking a sketch\nof it, which I send you in this letter, with a portrait of my little\nDidier at its foot, lying sound asleep at full length upon the temple of\nthe god. It does not look like him, to be sure; but it will give you an\nidea of the fantastic and charming picture which I have had before my\neyes for the last fifteen minutes.\n\n\"As for other matters, I do not read at all here. I have not Peyraque\'s\neight or ten stray volumes and his big old Protestant Bible. I no longer\ntry to improve myself; I hardly think of it even. I mend the clothing of\nmy Didier, following him step by step; I dream, I am sad, but not\nrebellious, and not given to wondering any further about a state of\nthings to which I ought to submit,--and I am in good health, which is\nthe most important thing.\n\n\"Good old Peyraque comes in, bringing your letter. Ah! my sister, do not\ngive up weakly, or I shall be in despair. You say _he_ is pale, already\nill; and this gave you so much pain that you came near betraying me.\nCamille, if you have not strength enough to see a courageous man suffer,\nand if you do not understand that my courage alone can support his, I\nwill set out again; I will go farther away still, and you shall not know\nwhere I am. Consider yourself notified, that the day I see the mark of a\nstrange foot upon the sand of my island, I shall disappear so entirely\nthat--\"\n\n\nCaroline left the sentence unfinished; Peyraque, who had just given her\nMadame Heudebert\'s letter, came back saying, \"Here is the _gentleman_\ncoming.\"\n\n\"Who? what?\" cried Caroline, rising and evidently quite troubled. \"What\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"The father of the unknown child,--M. Bernyer he calls himself.\"\n\n\"Then you know his name? No one here knew it or would tell it.\"\n\n\"On my word, I am not very curious; but he threw his valise on a bench\nat Roquebert\'s door, and my eye happened to fall upon it, so I read.\"\n\n\"Bernyer! I don\'t know any such person; perhaps I might show myself\nwithout getting into difficulty.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly you must see him, to tell him about the little one; now\nis the time.\"\n\nRoquebert came in, however, and defeated Peyraque\'s design. M. Bernyer\nwas asking for his son; but, according to his custom, he had gone into a\nroom, reserved for him especially, and did not wish, just then, to see\nany one not of the family.\n\n\"It is all the same,\" added Roquebert. \"I will tell him how you took\ncare of my wife and the little boy, and he will certainly give me\nsomething good to repay you with. Otherwise I will do it myself, out of\nmy own pocket. Be easy about that.\"\n\nHe took the child in his arms and went out, closing the door behind him,\nas if to shut out even a curious look from following him into the\npassage leading to the stranger\'s room.\n\n\"Well, let us set out,\" said Caroline, whose eyes were full of tears at\nthe thought that she would probably never see Didier again.\n\n\"No,\" replied Peyraque, \"let us wait a little and see what the gentleman\nwill think, when he knows you have stayed here five days to take care of\nhis child.\"\n\n\"But don\'t you see, my friend, that Roquebert will take care not to tell\nhim? He will never dare to own that, during his wife\'s illness, he knew\nof nothing better than trusting the child to a stranger. And beside, is\nhe not anxious to keep Didier a year longer, which would be very\nfeasible? Will he let us give the father a hint that the child would not\nonly be better cared for, with us, but also educated as he needs to be\nat his age? No, no. Dame Roqueberte herself, in spite of the care I have\ngiven her, will say that no one knows me, that perhaps I am only an\nadventuress; and while seeking gratitude and confidence, we shall look\nas if we were intriguing to get the few sous which have been offered us\nalready.\"\n\n\"But when we refuse them it will be seen who we are. I am known myself;\nit is understood that Samuel Peyraque has never lied or held out his\nhand for money.\"\n\n\"This stranger knows nothing of all that, and he will inquire of the\nRoqueberts only because he knows nobody else. Let me set out quickly, my\ndear friend; I suffer every minute I stay here.\"\n\n\"Just as you like,\" said Peyraque. \"I have not unharnessed, and we can\nlet the horse rest at Le Puy; but nevertheless, if you would trust me,\nwe should remain here one or two hours. Going thither from here, we\nwould naturally meet on the way; the child would come to you and ask for\nyou himself, he is so fond of you already. Look here now! If the\ngentleman should see you only one minute, I am sure he would say, \'Here\nis a person who is like no one else: I must speak to her.\' And when he\nhad talked with you--\"\n\nArguing in this way, Peyraque followed Caroline, who had gathered up her\nclothing and was turning her steps toward the castle gate, quite\ndetermined to start. Passing before the bench where the stranger\'s\nvalise was still lying beside his travelling-cloak, she read the name\nwhich Peyraque had reported faithfully; but at the same time she made a\ngesture of surprise and hurried along with unusual agitation.\n\n\"What is it now? asked the good man, taking the reins.\n\n\"Nothing,--a fancy!\" replied Caroline, when they were out of the\nenclosure. \"I imagined I recognized the hand of the person who wrote the\nname of Bernyer on that valise.\"\n\n\"Bah! it was written just like print.\"\n\n\"That is true; I am silly! Never mind; let us go on, my good Peyraque.\"\n\nCaroline was absorbed in thought all the way. She accounted for the\nsingular emotion which the sight of this disguised handwriting had\ncaused her by what she had just experienced in reading her sister\'s\nletter; but she had a new anxiety. M. de Villemer had never told her\nthat he had seen the castle of Polignac with his own eyes, but he had\ngiven a fine description of it, and an accurate one, in his book; he had\ntaken it as an example of the strength of feudal restorations in the\nMiddle Ages, and Caroline knew he often travelled into the provinces, in\norder to get a distinct impression of historic places. She searched all\nthe recesses of her memory to find what could not possibly be there, to\nsee if the Marquis had not accidentally chanced to tell her that he had\nvisited Polignac. \"No,\" replied she to herself, \"if he had said so, I\nshould have been impressed by it on account of the names Lantriac and Le\nPuy, which Justine had mentioned.\" Then she tried to remember whether,\nin connection with Polignac, she had not spoken of Lantriac and Justine;\nbut she had never mentioned either of them to him, she was quite sure;\nso she grew calmer.\n\nYet she was agitated and thoughtful. Why had she taken such a fancy to\nthis unknown child? What was the peculiarity in his eyes, his attitude,\nand his smile? Was it that he looked like the Marquis? In the idea which\nhad so suddenly presented itself, of educating a little child and\nwishing for this one, might there not have been a vague instinct more\npowerful than chance or Peyraque\'s instigations?\n\nWith all this uneasiness there came, too, in Caroline\'s despite, the\nsecret torment of a confused jealousy. \"He has a son, then, a child of\nlove?\" said she to herself. \"He must, then, have loved some woman\npassionately before he knew me, for frivolous adventures are\nincompatible with his exclusive nature, and there has been an important\nmystery in his past life! The mother is still living perhaps. Why is she\nsupposed to be dead?\"\n\nAdvancing among these feverish speculations, she recalled the words of\nthe Marquis under the cedar in the Jardin des Plantes, and the struggle\nshe had caught a glimpse of between his filial duty and some other duty,\nsome other love, of which she herself might not be the object after all.\nWho knew whether the old Marchioness had not been equally at fault,\nwhether the Marquis had told his mother the name of the person he wanted\nto marry; in short, whether she herself and Madame de Villemer had not\nboth missed the truth?\n\nThus working herself into an involuntary excitement, Caroline strove in\nvain to feel reconciled to her fate. She loved, and for her the stronger\nfeeling now was the fear rather than the hope of not being loved in\nreturn.\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" asked Peyraque, who had learned to read her\nanxieties in her face.\n\nShe replied by overwhelming him with questions about this M. Bernyer\nwhom he had seen once. Peyraque had a keen eye and a memory; but,\nhabitually thoughtful and reserved, he bestowed his attention only on\npeople who especially interested him. He drew, then, a picture of this\npretended Bernyer so vague and incomplete that Caroline made no\nprogress. She slept poorly that night, but toward morning she grew calm,\nand awoke saying to herself that there had been no common sense in her\nexcitement of the day before.\n\nPeyraque, having to go his rounds, could not linger till her awakening.\nHe came in at nightfall. His air was triumphant.\n\n\"Our affair is working well,\" said he. \"M. Bernyer will come here\nto-morrow, and you may rest easy; he is an Englishman, a sailor. You\ndon\'t know any such person, do you?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" replied Caroline. \"You saw him again, then?\"\n\n\"No, he had just gone out; but I saw Dame Roqueberte, who is better and\nbegins to have her senses. She told me the little one cried last night,\nand before he fell asleep asked over and again for his Charlette. The\nfather inquired who she was. It seems that Roquebert had no great wish\nto speak of you; but his wife, who is a good Christian, and the little\ngirl, who is fond of you too, said you were an angel from heaven, and\nthe gentleman replied he would like to thank you, and make you some\nrecompense. He asked where you lived; he has never been at our house,\nbut remembered me perfectly, and said he would come and see us soon. He\npromised the child this, and even that he would bring you back, in order\nto make him go to sleep.\"\n\n\"In all this,\" said Caroline, \"I see only one thing, and that is, this\nstranger is coming to offer me money.\"\n\n\"Well, let him do it; so much the better! It will be an opportunity to\nshow him you are not what he thinks. You will see one another, you will\nconverse; he will find you are an educated young lady, above what he\nsupposes you are, and I will tell him your history, because this history\nof yours does you credit.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Caroline, quickly. \"What! shall I intrust my secret to\na stranger, after so many precautions to conceal my name and position?\"\n\n\"But since you do not know him?\" said Justine. \"If you are agreed on the\nmatter of the child, he should be intrusted with the whole. Having his\nsecret, we can afford to give him ours. He would have no inducement to\nbetray it.\"\n\n\"Justine!\" cried Mlle de Saint-Geneix, who was near a window that faced\nthe street. \"Listen! Heaven! not another word. There he is, certainly,\nthis M. Bernyer. He is coming here, and it is--yes, I was sure--it is\nhe! It is M. de Villemer! O my friends, hide me! Tell him I am gone,\nthat I am not coming back!--If he sees me, if he speaks to me,--can\'t\nyou feel that I am lost?\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nJustine followed Caroline, who had escaped to her own room, and made\nsigns to Peyraque that he should receive the Marquis and be\nself-possessed.\n\nPeyraque was equal to the emergency. He received M. de Villemer with the\ncalm dignity of a man who has the most rigid ideas of duty. It was no\nlonger a question of putting him in communication with the pretended\nCharlette; it was necessary to get him away before any suspicions arose\nin his mind, or, in case they had already arisen, to dispel them at\nonce. From the first words of the Marquis, Peyraque saw that he\nsuspected nothing. Desirous to set out again in a few days with his son,\nwhom he intended to keep nearer to himself in future, he had made the\nmost of a fine morning to come on foot and repay this debt of gratitude\nto some generous stranger. He had not supposed the distance so great,\nand was, therefore, a little late in arriving. He confessed he was\nsomewhat tired, and, in point of fact, his face betrayed both weariness\nand suffering.\n\nPeyraque hastened to offer him food and drink, the duties of hospitality\npreceding everything else. He called Justine, who had, by this time,\nregained her composure; and they waited upon M. de Villemer, who,\ncatching at this opportunity of rewarding his entertainers generously,\naccepted their services with a good grace. He learned with regret that\nCharlette had gone away; but there was no reason why he should ask many\nquestions about her. He thought of leaving a present for her, which\nJustine, in a low tone, advised her husband to accept, that he might not\nbe surprised at anything. Caroline would readily find a chance to send\nit back. Peyraque did not see the necessity; his pride revolted at the\nidea of seeming to accept money on her account.\n\nCaroline, in her little chamber, overheard this strife on a point of\ndelicacy. The voice of the Marquis sent shudders through her. She dared\nnot stir. It seemed as if M. de Villemer would recognize her footfall\nthrough the flooring. He, for his part, hoping to find a way of\ndischarging his obligations under some different form, pretended and\nreally tried to eat a little; and after this inquired whether he could\nhire a horse to return with. The night was dark and the rain came on\nagain. Peyraque agreed to carry him back and went out to get his wagon\nready; but first, he climbed up softly to Caroline\'s room. \"This poor\ngentleman makes me uneasy,\" said he in a low voice. \"He is very ill,\nthat I am sure of. You can see drops of sweat on his forehead, and yet\nhe creeps up to the fire like a man with a fever-chill. He could not\nswallow two morsels, and when he breathes hard it seems to affect his\nheart like a spasm, for he puts his hand there, smiling bravely all the\nwhile, but afterwards carrying it to his head, as one does in severe\npain.\n\n\"Heavens!\" exclaimed Caroline, in alarm, \"when he is ill it is so\ndangerous! You must not carry him back to-night; your wagon is not easy,\nand then the bad roads and the cold, and this rain and his fever! No,\nno, he must stay here to-night. But where, pray? He would rather sleep\nout of doors than at the inn, which is so untidy. There is only one way.\nKeep him from going, keep him here. Give him my room. I will gather up\nmy things; it will not take long, and I will go to your\ndaughter-in-law\'s.\"\n\n\"With my son\'s wife or in the village, you will be too near. If he\nshould happen to be a little worse in the night you would come in spite\nof yourself, to take care of him.\"\n\n\"That is true. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to say? Well, you have courage and health: I will take\nyou to Laussonne, where you can pass the night with my sister-in-law; it\nis as neat there as it is here, and to-morrow, after he goes, I will\ncome for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" said Caroline, doing up her bundle hastily. \"Make\nhim agree to stay, and tell your son, as you go by, to harness Mignon.\"\n\n\"No, not Mignon! he has been travelling all day. We must take the mule.\"\n\nPeyraque, having given his orders, returned to tell the Marquis the rain\nhad set in for the whole evening, which was indeed true; and, giving\nJustine a significant glance, he urged him to stay so cordially that M.\nde Villemer consented. \"You are right, my friends,\" said he, with his\nheart-broken smile; \"I am somewhat ill, and I am one of those who have\nno right to wish for death.\"\n\n\"No one has that right,\" replied Peyraque; \"but you will not be\ndangerously sick here with us, I assure you. My wife will take good care\nof you. The chamber up above is very clean and warm, and if you get\nworse you have only to knock lightly, just once; we shall hear it.\"\n\nJustine went up stairs to prepare his room and embrace poor Caroline,\nwho was really dismayed. \"What!\" said Caroline, speaking very low; \"I\nknow he is sick and I am going to desert him in this way. No. I was mad!\nI will stay.\"\n\n\"But that is just what Peyraque will never let you do,\" replied Justine.\n\"Peyraque is stern; but what would you! Perhaps he is right. If you take\npity on one another now, you will never be able to part again. And\nthen--for myself I am sure you would never do anything wrong, but the\nmother--And then, think what other people might say!\"\n\nCaroline would not listen; Peyraque went up stairs, took her hand with\nan air of authority, and made her come down. She had put her poor heart\nunder the guidance of this Protestant of the Cévennes; there was no\nlonger any way of drawing back.\n\nHe led her out to the carriage and put in her bundle. At this moment\nCaroline, who had really lost her senses, escaped from his grasp, darted\ninto the house through the kitchen-door, and caught sight of M. de\nVillemer, who was seated with his back toward her. She went no farther;\nher reason returned. And then his appearance reassured her a little. He\nhad not that bruised, broken-down aspect she had seen him wear on the\nnight of his former attack. He was sitting before the fire, reading in\nPeyraque\'s Bible. The little iron lamp hanging from the mantel-piece\nthrew its light on his black hair, wavy like his son\'s, and partly also\non his clear, strong forehead. M. de Villemer was doubtless suffering\nmuch, but he still wished to live; he had not lost hope.\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Caroline, returning to Peyraque. \"He did n\'t see me,\nand I have seen him! I am more at ease. Let us start; but you must\npromise on your honor,\" added she, as she drew near the step of the\ncarriage, \"that if he is taken to-night with suffocation you will come\nfor me at whatever damage to your horse. It must be done, do you see? No\none else knows what this sick man needs in way of care--and you--you\nwould see him die in your own house, and you would have it on your\nconscience forever!\"\n\nPeyraque promised, and they set out. The weather was dreadful, and the\nroad frightful; but Peyraque knew every one of its holes and its stones.\nBesides, the distance was short. He left Caroline at the house of his\nsister-in-law, and had reached home again by eleven o\'clock.\n\nThe Marquis was feeling better; he had gone to lie down after having\nchatted with Justine in such a friendly way that she was delighted. \"Do\nyou see, Peyraque, this man,\" said she, \"he has a good heart like hers--\nI can understand it perfectly myself--\"\n\n\"Stop talking now,\" said Peyraque, who knew the thinness of the\nflooring; \"if he is asleep, we ought to sleep too.\"\n\nAt Lantriac the night passed in absolute quiet. The Marquis actually\nrested, and at two o\'clock awoke, having shaken off the fever. He felt\nimbued with a pleasant calm, such as he had not known for a long time,\nand he attributed this to some sweet dream that he had forgotten, though\nits impression remained. Unwilling to awaken his hosts, he kept still,\ngazing at the four walls of the little chamber, brightly lighted by his\nlamp, and grasping the facts of his position more positively than he had\ndone before since Caroline\'s departure. He had debated a thousand\nextreme measures; then he had said to himself that his first duty was to\nhis son; and the sight of this child had given him the force of will he\nneeded to resist the physical disease which now began to threaten him\nanew. Within twenty-four hours he had fixed upon a definite plan. He\nwould take Didier to Madame Heudebert, leaving with her a letter for\nCaroline, and then quit France for some time, so that Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix, reassured by his absence, might return to be near her\nsister at Étampes. In the course of a few quiet weeks, the Marchioness\nwould perhaps get further information, or perhaps her secret would be\ndiscovered by the Duke, who had sworn he would draw it from her by\nsurprise. If the Duke failed, Urbain was not at the end of his\nresources. He would come back quietly to the castle of Mauveroche, where\nhis mother, was to pass the summer with her daughter-in-law, and he\nwould not let Caroline know of his return until he had cleared her in\nhis mother\'s estimation, and thus again smoothed away every difficulty.\n\nThe most important and the most urgent thing, then, was to draw Mlle de\nSaint-Geneix from her mysterious hiding-place. The Marquis still thought\nshe was in some Parisian convent. He found himself compelled to stay a\nfew days longer in Polignac to make sure of Dame Roqueberte\'s complete\nrecovery, before grieving her by taking away his son, and this delay had\nfretted him more than anything else. To cheat his impatience, he asked\nhimself why he should not write to Madame Heudebert at once and to\nCaroline also, that they might be prepared to rejoin each other after\nhis departure for a foreign land. By this means he would perhaps gain a\nfew days. He could mail the letter at once, as he would pass through Le\nPuy on his return to Polignac.\n\nWhat gave him the idea of writing from Lantriac was, mainly, the sight\nof the little bureau, where Caroline had left pens, some ink in a cup,\nand a few stray sheets of paper. These objects, on which his gaze\nfastened mechanically, seemed inviting him to follow his inspiration. He\nrose noiselessly, put the lamp on the table, and wrote to Caroline.\n\n\"My friend, my sister, you will not desert an unhappy man, who, for a\nyear past, has centred in you the hopes of his life. Caroline, do not\nmistake my meaning. I have a favor to ask of you which you cannot\nrefuse. I am going away.\n\n\"I have a son who has no mother. I love him devotedly; I intrust him to\nyou. Come back!--As for myself, I go to England. You shall never see me\nagain, if you have lost faith in me,--but that is impossible. When have\nI been unworthy of your esteem? Caroline--\"\n\nThe Marquis stopped abruptly. An object of little importance had caught\nhis eye. The ordinary paper, the steel pens, had no peculiarities; but\none black bead lay on the table between his hand and the inkstand, a\ntrifle insignificant in itself, but one bringing with it a whole world\nof memories. It was a bit of jet, cut and perforated in a certain\nunusual fashion. It was part of a valueless bracelet Caroline had worn\nat Séval; which he easily recognized because she used to take it off\nwhenever she wrote, and he had himself formed a habit of toying with\nthis bracelet while talking to her. He had handled it a hundred times,\nand one day she had said to him, \"Pray don\'t break it, it is all I have\nleft from my mother\'s jewel-box.\" He had looked at it respectfully, and\nheld it lovingly in his hands. Just as she was on the point of quitting\nher little room in Lantriac, Caroline, in her precipitation, had broken\nthis bracelet; she had picked up the beads hastily, leaving behind but\nthis one.\n\nThis black bead reversed all the ideas of the Marquis; but what kind of\ndreaming was this? These cut jets might be an industrial product of the\ncountry he was then in. Nevertheless he sat motionless, absorbed in new\nsurmises. He breathed and questioned the vague perfume of the room. He\nlooked everywhere without moving from his chair. There was nothing on\nthe walls, nothing on the table, nothing on the mantel. Finally he\nbecame aware of some bits of paper in the fireplace, which were not\ncompletely charred. He bent over the ashes, searched minutely, and found\none single fragment of an address, only two syllables of which were\nlegible: one, written by hand, was the last in the word Lantriac, the\nother, \"am,\" forming part of the postmark. The postmark was that of\nÉtampes, the handwriting that of Madame Heudebert. There could be no\nlonger a doubt: Charlette was no one but Caroline, and perhaps she had\nnever gone away, perhaps she was still in the house.\n\nFrom that moment, the Marquis had the cunning, the watchfulness, the\ncoolness, and the keen perception of a savage. He discovered the pipe\nfrom the little spring leading down to the sink below. The pipe itself\nwas stopped up, but there was more than one fissure in the plaster which\nsurrounded it. He put his ear down to it closely, and caught Peyraque\'s\nlong, even breathing as he lay yet asleep.\n\nNot a word, though spoken ever so low, could then escape him. In a few\nmoments he distinctly heard Justine rise, uttering the words, \"Come, get\nup, Peyraque; perhaps poor Caroline has not been sleeping so well as we\nhave!\"\n\n\"A night is a night,\" said Peyraque; \"besides, I can\'t go for her till\nafter he has gone away.\"\n\nJustine listened and replied, \"He does n\'t stir, but he said he should\nget up at daybreak. Daylight is n\'t far off now; he means to go away\nwithout taking anything, he said so.\"\n\n\"It is all the same,\" rejoined Peyraque, who had now risen, and whose\nvoice was even more audible, though he spoke quite low; \"I don\'t want\nhim to set out on foot; it is too far. The lad shall saddle my horse,\nand when I have seen him fairly off, I will start for Laussonne.\"\n\nM. de Villemer had made sure. He stirred a little to show he was up, and\nwent down stairs after having slipped his purse into the bureau-drawer.\nHe seemed very impatient to get back to Polignac, and declaring he felt\nperfectly strong, obstinately refused the horse. It would have been an\nencumbrance in the war of observation he was about to wage. He shook\nhands cordially with his entertainers and set out; but, on the borders\nof the village, having inquired about the road of a passer-by, he\nchanged his course, plunging into a by-way that led to Laussonne.\n\nHe thought he could arrive there in advance of Peyraque, wait for him\nstealthily, and see him take Caroline back. When he had made sure of her\nreturn to Lantriac, he would lay his plans further. Until then, being\nquite aware she was trying to escape him, he would not risk losing track\nof her again. But Peyraque was very expeditious; Mignon travelled fast\nin spite of the roads which grew worse and worse, forming one unbroken\nascent in the direction of Laussonne, and crossing more than one\nmountain declivity. The by-path cut off the angles of the main road but\nslightly, and the Marquis was distanced by the rustic equipage. He saw\nit pass and recognized Peyraque, who, for his part, thought he\ndistinguished, in the morning fog, a man who was not in peasant garb,\nand who quickly retreated behind an embanking wall of rough stones.\n\nPeyraque was suspicious. \"Very likely,\" thought he, \"he has been fooling\nus, or he has found out something. Well! if it is he, and if he is no\nmore of an invalid than that, I will cure him of trying to follow a\nmountain horse on foot.\"\n\nHe urged Mignon forward, and arrived at Laussonne with the first rays of\nthe sun. Caroline, in deadly anxiety, after a cruelly sleepless night,\ncame out to meet him.\n\n\"All is going well,\" said he. \"I was mistaken yesterday; he is not so\nvery ill, for he slept well and would return on foot.\"\n\n\"So he is gone?\" replied Caroline, climbing to her seat by Peyraque. \"He\nnever suspected anything, then? And I shall never see him again? Well,\nso much the better!\" and she burst into tears under her hood, which she\npulled over her face in vain. Peyraque heard her sob as if her heart\nwould break.\n\n\"So you are the one going to be sick now?\" said he, in a tone of\npaternal severity. \"Come, be reasonable, or your Peyraque will never\nbelieve you when you tell him you are a Christian.\"\n\n\"So long as I do not weep before him, can you not excuse one moment of\nweakness in me? But what are you doing? Why are we going on toward\nLaussonne?\"\n\nPeyraque thought he again caught sight of the Marquis still creeping\nonward. \"You must excuse me,\" said he, \"but I have an errand to do in\nthe village. It is quite near.\"\n\nHe entered the village, shrewdly thinking that the Marquis would still\nkeep himself in sight at a distance. He went up the street and exchanged\na few words with one of the townspeople. Pretexts could not fail to be\nat hand. Then, returning to Caroline, he said, \"You see, my daughter,\nyou have too much on your mind. I want to revive your spirits; you know\nan excursion always does you good. Would you like to have me take you on\none--O, a very pleasant one!\"\n\n\"If you have business anywhere, I don\'t want to incommode you. I will go\nwherever you like.\"\n\n\"I shall have to go to the foot of Mézenc, to the village of Estables.\nIt is a beautiful place really, and you have been longing to see the\ngrandest of the Cévennes.\"\n\n\"You said it would be hard travelling over there until after next\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Bless me! Why, the weather is cloudy, to be sure, and perhaps the roads\nare a little damaged. I have n\'t passed over them since last year; but\nthey have been worked upon, as I have heard, and besides you know with\nme there is no danger.\"\n\n\"I assure you I am in no mood to worry about danger. Let us set out.\"\n\nPeyraque hurried on his horse, which soon crossed the boundaries of\nLaussonne and bravely descended the rocky hill, climbing the other slope\nagain without delay, and even more rapidly. When they had reached the\ntop, Peyraque turned round, saw no one in the paths behind him, and\nlooked at the road ahead, which was taking on a discouraging aspect.\n\"You are going to see a wilderness,\" said he; \"but that need n\'t annoy\nyou, need it?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied she; \"when we are desperate we cease to be annoyed.\"\n\nPeyraque went on, not without warning his companion repeatedly that the\nsun might not be disposed to shine, that they had four leagues to go,\nand that perhaps Mézenc would be under a fog. All this had little\ninterest for Caroline, who did not guess the hesitation of her old\nfriend or his qualms of conscience.\n\nThey traversed a mountain wooded with pines, and cut into by a vast\nglade,--the result of an ancient felling of the trees,--which opened a\ngigantic avenue, where the road, from a distance, looked like a highway\nfor a hundred chariots abreast; but when the little carriage had\nventured in, it was a frightful task to get over the ground, rain-soaked\nand hollowed out into deep ruts in a thousand places. Further on, it was\nworse still; the turf was strewed with blocks of lava, which left boggy\nplaces between them; and when they found traces of the travelled road\nagain, they had to turn aside for monstrous piles of flints and pebbles,\nto stop altogether before deep cuts or trenches, to seek the old road\namong twenty others that lost themselves in the morass. The horse\nperformed prodigies of courage, and Peyraque miracles of skill and\njudgment.\n\nAt the expiration of two hours, they had accomplished only two leagues,\nand were in open country on an interminable plateau, at an elevation of\nfifteen hundred metres. Except the breaks here and there in the road,\nnothing could be distinguished. The sun had disappeared; a thick mist\nenshrouded everything, and nothing can paint the feeling of bitter\ndesolation which fell upon Caroline. Peyraque himself lost courage and\nkept silence. The obstructed road, which, he had been forced to leave\none side did not reappear, and for the last fifteen minutes they had\nbeen pacing over a spongy turf, broken up by the hoofs of cattle in\nsearch of pasturage, but no longer bearing any traces of wheels. The\nhorse stopped, bathed in sweat; he thus gave warning that he had never\nbeen over this ground before.\n\nPeyraque alighted, sinking almost knee deep in the boggy soil, and tried\nto find where he was. It was out of the question. The mountains and\nravines were only one plain of white vapor.\n\n\"Have we lost our way?\" asked Caroline with cool indifference.\n\nAt this point the wind made a little opening in the fog, and they saw in\nthe distance fantastic horizons empurpled by the sun; but the mist\nclosed in again so quickly that Peyraque could not determine his\nposition from this isolated peak in the distant circle of mountains.\nHowever, they heard a confused barking and then voices, though they\ncould not distinguish the dogs till they were quite upon them. These\ndogs were the advance-guard of a caravan of men and mules carrying\nvegetables and leather bottles. They were mountaineers who had been down\nto the plains to exchange the cheese and butter of their cows for the\nfruits and vegetables of the level country. They accosted Peyraque, who\nasked information. They told him that he had done very wrong to think of\ngoing with a carriage to Estables at this season, that it could not be\ndone, and that he would have to return. Peyraque showed some obstinacy,\nand asked if he was still far from the village. They guided him into the\nroad again, telling him he had work before him for an hour and a half;\nbut as their animals were loaded and warm, and they themselves in haste\nto arrive, these mountaineers offered no assistance, and disappeared,\nwith a laugh at the little carriage. Caroline saw them rapidly vanish\ninto the fog like shadows.\n\nIt was absolutely necessary to let the horse breathe, for a fresh effort\nto regain the solid road had exhausted him. \"What comforts me,\" said\nPeyraque, really moved, \"is that you don\'t complain of anything! It is\nvery cold, nevertheless, and I\'m sure the dampness has gone through your\ncloak.\"\n\nCaroline replied only by a shiver.\n\nA new shadow had just passed along the side of the road; it was M. de\nVillemer. He pretended not to see the carriage, although he did see it\nperfectly; but he chose to seem unconscious that it held any one he\nknew. He advanced with extraordinary energy, affecting an air of\nindifference.\n\n\"It is he! I saw him,\" said Caroline to Peyraque. \"He goes wherever we\ngo.\"\n\n\"Well, let him go on, and we will turn back.\"\n\n\"No, I cannot, I will not! He will die after such a walk. He will never\nreach Estables. Let us follow him.\"\n\nThis time Caroline\'s terror was so commanding that Peyraque obeyed. They\ncame up with M. de Villemer, who moved aside to let them pass, without\nstopping or looking up. He would be neither intrusive nor rebellious,\nbut he would know, he would follow to the death.\n\nUnfortunately he was at the end of his strength. The difficulty of this\nwalk, which from Lantriac had been a continual ascent and, for the last\ntwo leagues, one chaos of stones and peaty turf, had started on him a\nprofuse perspiration which he could feel freezing in the blast of a\nsharp wind that had suddenly veered to the east. He lost his breath, and\nwas forced to stop.\n\nCaroline turned her head toward him, and was on the point of crying out.\nPeyraque seized her arm. \"Courage, my daughter,\" he said, with his stern\nreligious fervor. \"The Lord requires it at your hands.\" And she felt\nherself overborne by the strong faith of the peasant.\n\n\"What do you want to do for him?\" resumed Peyraque, as he still drove\non. \"He has had strength to come so far, he will have enough to go the\nrest of the way. A man does not die from the effects of a walk. He will\nrest at Estables. And if he is sick,--I shall be there.\"\n\n\"But he is following me! You see I shall have to speak to him there or\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"Why should he follow you? He does not suspect you are here even. So\nmany travellers want to see Mézenc.\"\n\n\"In such weather as this?\"\n\n\"The sun rose brightly, and we ourselves started to see Mézenc.\"\n\nThe Marquis saw Caroline hesitate and submit. This was the final blow.\nNo sooner had he seen himself left behind than he felt he could go no\nfarther. He sank down on a stone, his eyes fixed on the black speck\nslowly vanishing from his sight, for the wind had risen suddenly and was\nviolently scattering the fog, in whose stead there now came light\nflurries of snow and sleet. \"So she would have me know nothing more of\nher?\" said he to himself, as he felt his strength failing. \"She flees\nfrom hope, she has lost faith. Then she never loved me!\"\n\nAnd he lay down to die.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\n\"We must hasten, we must hasten!\" said Peyraque, at the close of another\nhalf-hour, as he saw the snow deepening. \"Here is something worse than\nfog. When this begins to fall it soon piles up in the road higher than\nyour head.\"\n\nThis imprudent admission set Caroline in open rebellion; she wanted to\njump from the carriage, fully determined to walk back to the place where\nshe had met M. de Villemer.\n\nPeyraque dissuaded her from this; but finally had to yield and return,\nin spite of the ever-increasing danger and the difficulties of a still\nslower progress over the half-league they had so painfully traversed\nsince losing sight of the Marquis.\n\nIt was in vain for them to search by simply looking for him. In one hour\nthe snow in large, spreading flakes had buried up the ground and its\nruggedness. It was impossible for them to tell whether they had not\npassed by the place they wanted to explore. Caroline uttered groans,\ninaudible to herself, finding no words at her command but the faint\noutcry, \"My God, my God!\" Peyraque no longer strove to quiet her, and\nonly encouraged her by telling her to look carefully.\n\nSuddenly the horse stopped. \"It must be we have found the road again\nhere,\" said Peyraque. \"Mignon remembers.\"\n\n\"Then we have come too far,\" replied Caroline.\n\n\"But we have met no one,\" returned Peyraque. \"This gentleman, seeing the\nstorm coming on, has gone back to Laussonne, and we, who are nearer\nEstables, are running a great risk in staying here, unless it stops\nsnowing. I give you warning.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on, Peyraque!\" cried Caroline, leaping into the snow. \"For my\npart, I shall stay here till I find him.\"\n\nPeyraque made no reply. He alighted and began searching, but without the\nleast hope. There was already half a foot of snow, and the wind,\ndrifting it into every hollow, would soon bury up a corpse.\n\nCaroline walked on at random, gliding forward like a spirit, so great\nwas her excitement. She was already at some little distance from the\ncarriage when she heard the horse snort loudly as he put down his head.\nShe thought he was dying, and, watching him with real distress, saw him\nscenting out something in front of him in a strange way. It was a\nrevelation; she darted forward and perceived a gloved hand, apparently\nbelonging to one dead, which the breath of the horse, melting the snow\nover it, had brought to light. The body extended beneath was the\nobstacle which the animal had refused to tread under foot. Peyraque came\nrunning at Caroline\'s call, and, extricating M. de Villemer, put him in\nthe carriage, where Mlle de Saint-Geneix held him up and tried to warm\nhim in her arms.\n\nPeyraque took the bridle and walked on again in the direction of\nMézenc. He knew perfectly there was not a moment to lose, but went on\nwithout knowing where to set foot; and he soon disappeared in a ravine\nwhich he was unable to clear. The horse stopped of his own accord;\nPeyraque got up again, but, on trying to make him back, found the wheels\ncaught in some unseen obstacle. Besides, the horse was at the end of his\nstrength. Peyraque treated him harshly, but all to no purpose; he struck\nhis pony for the first time in his life; he pulled on the bridle till\nthe creature\'s mouth bled. The poor animal turned upon him with a glance\nof almost human intelligence, as if to say, \"I have done all I could; I\ncan do nothing more to save you.\"\n\n\"Must we then perish here?\" said Peyraque, disheartened, as he watched\nthe snow falling in inexorable whirls. The plateau had become a Siberian\nwaste, beyond which Mézenc alone showed his livid head between the\ngusts of wind. Not a tree, not a roof, not a rock for shelter. Peyraque\nknew there was nothing to be done.\n\n\"Let us hope,\" said he, which, in these Southern forms of speech, simply\nmeans, \"Let us wait.\"\n\nIt soon occurred to him, however, that he would gain the next fifteen\nminutes, even if they should be the last of life. He took a small board\nfrom his little carriage, and fought with the drifting snow, which\nthreatened to bury up both horse and vehicle. Incessantly for ten\nminutes he worked like a wrestler at this task of clearing away, saying\nto himself that perhaps it was all useless, but that he would defend\nhimself and Caroline to the last breath.\n\nAt the expiration of the ten minutes he thanked God the snow grew\nlighter; the wind abated; the fog, which was far less dangerous, strove\nto reappear. He slackened his work without giving it over. At last he\nsaw something like a pale streak of light breaking through the depths of\nthe sky; it was a promise of fair weather.\n\nSo far he had not spoken a word or uttered an oath. If Caroline had been\nfated to perish there, she would not have suspected it till the last\nmoment. Yet he looked at her and found her so pale and her glance so\nwild that he was alarmed.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said he, \"what is the trouble? There is no more danger;\nthis will be nothing.\"\n\n\"O, nothing, is it?\" she replied, with a bitter smile, pointing to\nUrbain, stretched out on the seat of the little vehicle, his face livid\nwith the cold, his large eyes wide open and glazed, like those of a\ncorpse.\n\nPeyraque looked around him again. It was hopeless to expect human aid.\nHe sprang into the carriage, seized M. de Villemer firmly in his arms,\nrubbed him vigorously, bruised him in his iron hands, trying to impart\nto him the warmth of his own old blood reanimated by exercise and a\nstrong will; but it was all in vain. With the effects of the cold were\nunited those of a nervous crisis peculiar to the organization of the\nMarquis.\n\n\"He is not dead, though,\" said Peyraque. \"I feel that; I am sure of it.\nIf I only had something to make a fire with! But I can\'t make one of\nstones.\"\n\n\"We might burn the carriage, at all events,\" cried Caroline.\n\n\"That is an idea,--yes, but after that?\"\n\n\"After that perhaps the Lord will send help. Don\'t you see the first\nthing is to prevent death from laying hold of us here?\"\n\nPeyraque saw Caroline so pale and the blue lines so defined under her\neyes that he began to think she felt herself dying also. He hesitated no\nlonger, but risked all to save all. He unharnessed the pony, which, like\nthe horses of the Cossacks, at once rolled in the snow to rest himself.\nTaking the awning from his carriage and placing it on the ground,\nPeyraque carried M. de Villemer, still frozen and motionless, to it;\nthen, drawing from his boxes a few handfuls of hay, some old papers, and\nfragments of matting, he put the whole under the vehicle and struck fire\nwith the flint and steel with which he was accustomed to light his pipe.\nBreaking up with his farrier\'s tools the boards and planks of his poor\nlittle carriage, he succeeded in a few moments in kindling them into a\nblaze and into brands. He demolished and broke in pieces as fast as the\nfire burned. The snow no longer fell, and M. de Villemer, lying within a\nsemicircle of blazing wreck, began to gaze in a stupor at the strange\nscene, which he took for a dream.\n\n\"He is saved, saved! Do you hear, Peyraque?\" cried Caroline, who saw the\nMarquis making an attempt to rise. \"A hundred blessings on your head!\nYou have saved him!\"\n\nThe Marquis heard Caroline\'s voice close by him, but, still thinking it\nsome hallucination, made no effort to look at her. He did not comprehend\nwhat was taking place till he felt on his hands the distracted pressure\nof Caroline\'s lips. Then he thought he must be dying, as she no longer\navoided him, and, trying to smile, he bade her adieu in a faint voice.\n\n\"No, no; not adieu!\" she replied, covering his forehead with kisses;\n\"you must live. I will have it so! I love you!\"\n\nA slight flush came over the livid face, but no words could express his\njoy. The Marquis still feared it might be all a dream; yet he was\nplainly reviving. The warmth had concentrated under the carriage-top\nwhich served him as a shelter. He was as comfortable as he could\npossibly be made there, lying on the cloaks of Caroline and Peyraque.\n\n\"But we must go on, nevertheless,\" thought the latter, and his unquiet\neyes questioned the brightening horizon. The cold was severe, the fire\nwas going out for want of fuel, and the invalid surely could not walk to\nEstables. And was Caroline herself equal to such an attempt? To mount\nthem both on the horse was the only expedient; but would the exhausted\nanimal have strength to carry them? No matter, it would have to be\ntried; and, first of all, they must give the horse some oats. Peyraque\nlooked, but found none; the fire had consumed the little bag as well as\nthe box in which it was stored.\n\nAn exclamation from Caroline revived his hopes. She showed him a light\nvapor on the rising ground which sheltered them. He ran in that\ndirection, and saw below him an ox-cart, painfully approaching, the\ndriver smoking in order to keep warm.\n\n\"You see now,\" said Caroline, when the cart had nearly reached them,\n\"the Lord has helped us!\"\n\nM. de Villemer was still so weak that he had to be lifted into the cart,\nwhich, fortunately, was loaded with straw; and in this Peyraque buried\nhim up, after a fashion. Caroline placed herself near him. Peyraque\nbestrode his pony, leaving the wreck of his poor carriage behind, and in\nan hour they had finally reached the village of Estables.\n\nPeyraque went disdainfully by the inn of a certain giantess with bare\nlegs and a golden necklace, a veritable tardigrade of peculiar\nrepulsiveness. He knew the Marquis would find no zealous attention\nthere. He conducted him, to the house of a peasant whom he knew. The\npeople crowded around the invalid, overwhelming him with questions, and\nfriendly proffers which he did not understand. Peyraque, with an air of\nauthority, dismissed all who could be of no service, gave his orders,\nand went to work himself. In a few minutes the fire was blazing, and hot\nwine was foaming in the kettle. M. de Villemer, stretched on a thick bed\nof straw and dry turf, saw Caroline on her knees beside him, busily\nengaged in protecting his clothes from the fire and caring for him with\na mother\'s tenderness. She was uneasy about the terrible drink which\nPeyraque was brewing for him with strong spices; but the Marquis had\nconfidence in the experience of the mountaineer. He made a sign that he\nwould obey him, and Caroline, with trembling hand, put the cup to his\nlips. He was soon able to speak, thank his new hosts, and tell Peyraque,\npressing his hand warmly, that he would like to be alone with him and\nCaroline.\n\nIt was no easy thing to induce the family to forsake their own roof for\nseveral hours. Places of shelter are rare under this inclement sky, and\nthe flocks, the sole dependence of the Cévenois, are lodged in a way to\nleave no room for the inhabitants. Those living here, in particular,\nhave a reputation for rudeness and lack of hospitality which dates from\nthe murder of the mathematician sent by Cassini to measure the height of\nMézenc, and who was taken for a sorcerer. They have greatly improved,\nand now show themselves more civil; but their habits of life are those\nof the lowest poverty, and yet they are given to trading, raise\nmagnificent cattle, and are as well provided as possible with\ncommodities for barter. Still, the severity of the climate and the\nisolation of their rough dwelling-place have passed into their\ndispositions as well as into their blood.\n\nThe room which, with the stable, comprised the whole interior of the\nhouse, was given up at last to Peyraque and his friends. It was quite\nsmall, and hardly richer than the Celtic grotto of the old woman at\nEspaly. The smoke poured out partly through the chimney and partly,\nalso, through a gaping hole in the wall on one side. Two beds, shaped\nlike boxes, gave lodgings at night, in some incomprehensible way, to a\nfamily of six persons. The bare rock formed the floor; and on one side\nthe cows, goats, sheep, and hens took their comfort.\n\nPeyraque spread clean straw around everywhere, brought in a supply of\nwood, rummaged in the cupboard, found some bread, and urged Caroline to\neat and rest. The Marquis, with a look, begged her to think of herself,\nfor she dared not leave him a minute, and still held his hands in hers.\nHe wanted to speak; he was able to speak now, and yet he was afraid to\nsay a word. He feared she would go away from him as soon as she saw he\nknew himself beloved; and then Peyraque puzzled him cruelly. He did not\ncomprehend in the least the part played by this rustic Providence which,\nin its watch over Caroline, had shown itself so obstinate and so\nmerciless toward him; but which was now beginning to regard him with\nunbounded solicitude and devotion. At last Peyraque went out. He could\nnot forget his poor horse,--his faithful companion,--which he blamed\nhimself for having treated so brutally, and which, on his arrival, he\nhad been forced to intrust to the care of strangers.\n\n\"Caroline,\" said the Marquis, having seated himself on a stool, and\nstill leaning on her arm, \"I had many things to tell you, but I have not\nmy reason,--no, really, I have n\'t the use of it, and I\'m afraid to talk\nin my delirium. Forgive me, I am so happy,--happy to see you, to feel\nyou near me, now I have come back again from the verge of death. But I\ncannot trouble you any more. Heavens! what a burden I have been on your\nlife! It shall be so no longer; this is only an accident,--a foolish,\nimprudent act on my part; but how could I consent to lose you again? You\ndo not know, you never will know,--no, you have no idea, you don\'t\ncomprehend what you are to me; and perhaps you don\'t care ever to\ncomprehend it! To-morrow, perhaps, you will shun me again. And why,\npray? Here, read!\" he added, searching for and then handing her the\ncrumpled page of the letter begun at Lantriac that very morning; \"it\nmaybe illegible now; the rain and the snow--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Caroline, leaning toward the fire, \"I can see, I read\nperfectly, and--I understand. I knew before. I guessed; and I accept. It\nwas the wish of my heart,--the dream of my life. My heart and my life,\ndo they not both belong to you?\"\n\n\"Alas! no, not yet; but if you would believe in me--\"\n\n\"Don\'t tire yourself by talking, trying to convince me,\" said Caroline,\nwith something imperious in her warmth. \"I believe in you, but not in my\nown destiny. Well! I accept it, such as you make it for me. Good or ill,\nit shall be dear to me, since I can accept no other. Now listen, listen\nto me! Perhaps I have only an instant to tell you this in. I don\'t know\nwhat events your conscience and mine will have to meet; I know your\nmother to be inexorable. I have felt the chill of her contempt; and we\nhave nothing to hope from God if we break her heart. We must submit,\nthen, and that forever. You yourself have said that to form any scheme\nof being happy upon the loss of a mother is placing the dream of\nhappiness among the most criminal of thoughts, and such happiness would\nbe under the ban of a hundred curses; we ourselves should curse it in\nour hearts.\"\n\n\"Why do you remind me of all this?\" asked the Marquis, sorrowfully; \"do\nyou think I have forgotten? But you believe a change in my mother to be\nimpossible; and I see from this that you would not have me try to bring\nit about, and that pity alone--\"\n\n\"You see nothing at all,\" cried Caroline, putting her hand on his mouth;\n\"you see nothing, if you don\'t see that I love you.\"\n\n\"O Heaven!\" said the Marquis, sinking to her feet; \"say that again! It\nseems like a dream. This is the first time you have said it. I have\nthought I divined it, but I dare not believe it now. Tell me so\nagain,--tell me, and then let me die!\"\n\n\"Yes; I love you more than my own life,\" she replied, pressing to her\nheart the noble brow, seat of a soul so brave and true; \"I love you more\nthan my pride, more than my pride of womanhood. I have denied it to\nmyself this long time; I have denied it in my prayers to God, and I lied\nto God and to myself! At last I understood, and I fled through a\ncowardly weakness. I felt all was lost, and so it is. Well, what matters\nit, after all? It only involves myself. While I cherished the hope of\nlearning to forget, I could struggle; but you love me too well,--I see\nthat now,--and you will die, if I forsake you. I thought you were dead\na few hours ago, and then I saw clearly into our lives; I had killed\nyou! I might have saved you,--you, the noblest and best of beings,--but\nI made you the victim of my vain self-respect. And what am I to let you\ndie so, when all that is not your regard is nothing to me? No, no! I\nhave resisted long enough. I have been proud enough, cruel enough, and\nyou have suffered too much from my wrong-doing. I love you, do you hear?\nI will not become your wife, because that would be to plunge you into\nbitter remorse, into a woe beyond remedy; but I will be your friend,\nyour servant, a mother to your child, your faithful companion. The\npurity of our lives may be misunderstood; I shall be mistaken for\nDidier\'s actual mother perhaps. Well, I consent even to that. I accept\nthe scorn I have dreaded; and it seems to me drinking of this cup,\npoured out by you, will give me a new life.\"\n\n\"O noble heart! as pure as heaven!\" cried the Marquis. \"I accept, for my\npart, this divine sacrifice. Pray do not scorn me for that! You make me\nfeel worthy of it, and I will soon put an end to it. Yes, yes! I shall\nwork miracles. I feel strong enough now. My mother will yield without a\nregret. In my heart I feel now the faith and the power that shall\npersuade her to it. But even if the whole world should rise up to\ncondemn you,--do you see?--you, my sister and my daughter, my\npure-minded companion, my dearest friend,--you will only stand the\nhigher in my regard. I shall only be more and more proud of you. What is\nthe world, what is public opinion, to a man who has penetrated the\nsocial life of past ages and that of the present as well, fathoming the\nmysteries of their selfishness and the nothingness of their deceit? Such\na man knows full well that, at all times, by the side of one poor truth\nwhich floats safely, a thousand truths go under with the mark of infamy\nupon them. He well knows that the best and most unselfish spirits have\nwalked in the footprints of their Lord, on a thorny path, where wounds\nand insults fall like rain. Well, we will walk there, if need be; love\nwill keep us from feeling these base attacks. Yes, I can answer for\nthat, at least, and this is what I can swear in defiance of all threats\nfrom that destiny the world would make for us: you shall be loved, and\nyou shall be happy! You knew me well, cruel one, shutting your eyes as\nyou ran away. You knew perfectly that my whole life, my whole soul is\nlove and nothing else. You knew perfectly that, if I have sometimes been\neager in pursuit of truth, it was from love of her alone; and not for\nthe vain glory of proclaiming her in person. I am not myself a scholar;\nI am not an author. I am an unknown soldier, who, of my own free will,\navoid the noise and smoke of the conflict, fighting unsupported and in\nthe background, not through lack of courage, but that my mother and\nbrother may not be wounded in the struggle. I have accepted this obscure\nposition without a pang to my vanity. I felt that my heart stood in\nneed, not of praise, but of love. All the ambition of my fellows, all\ntheir immoderate vanities, their thirst for power, their needs of\nluxury, their continual hunger for notoriety,--what did all these matter\nto me? I could not be amused with toys like these. I was myself only a\npoor, single-hearted man, enamored of an ideal,--an ingenuous child, if\nyou will, seeking love and feeling it alive within him long before\nmeeting her who was to develop its power. I kept silence, knowing I\nshould have to bear raillery,--a thing indifferent, as far as I am\nconcerned personally, but one which would have pained me as an outrage\nto my inmost, sacred religion. Once, only once in my life,--I should\nlike to tell you this, Caroline,--I have loved--\"\n\n\"Don\'t tell me!\" cried she, \"I don\'t want to know.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, you ought to know all. She was good and gentle, and, in\nrecalling her, I can without an effort respect and bless her in her\ntomb; but she could not love me. It was the fault of her destiny, and\nnot her own. There is not a reproach in my heart for her; there are many\nfor myself. I have hated myself bitterly, and done heavy penance for\nhaving yielded to a passion which was never encouraged or really shared.\nI was only reconciled to life when I saw life blooming into its fairest\nand purest form in you. I then understood why I was born in tears, why I\nhad been fated to love, and condemned to love too early,--with sorrow,\nand in sin,--because I sought the one dream and aim of my life too\neagerly. And now I feel restored forever and saved. I feel that my\ncharacter will regain its balance, my youth its hopes, my heart its\nnatural sustenance. Have faith in me,--you whom Heaven has sent me! You\nknow for a certainty that we are made for each other. You have felt a\nthousand times, in spite of yourself that we had but one mind and one\nthought; that we loved the same principles, the same art, the same\nnames, the same people, and the same things without influencing each\nother, except to strengthen and develop what was already there,--to make\nthe germs of our deepest feelings bud and blossom. Do you remember,\nCaroline, do you remember Séval? And our sunny hours in the valley? And\nthe hours of delicious coolness beneath the arches of the library,\nwhere, with lovely vases of flowers, you paid festive honors to this\ndeep, mysterious union of our souls? Was it not an indissoluble marriage\nwhich our hands consecrated every morning in their pure touch of\ngreeting! Did not our first glance every single day give us to each\nother, and that for all time? And can all this be lost utterly, flown\nforever? Did you yourself believe for one instant that this man could\nlive without you, deprived of air and sunlight,--that he would consent\nto fall back into darkness again? No, no! you never believed it. He\nwould have followed you to the end of the earth; he would have gone\nthrough fire and water and ice to rejoin you. And if you had left me to\ndie in the snow to-day, can\'t you feel that my spirit set free would\nhave still, like a desperate spectre, pursued you through the mountain\nstorm?\"\n\n\"Listen to him, just listen!\" said Caroline to Peyraque, who had come in\nand was stupidly looking at the Marquis, now seemingly transfigured by\npassion; \"hear what he says, and do not wonder if I love him better than\nmyself. Do not be frightened, do not worry, do not go away, pitying us.\nStay with us and see how happy we are. The presence of a good old man\nlike you will not trouble us. Perhaps you will not understand us,--you\nwho would listen to nothing beyond a certain duty, which I understood\nyesterday, but no longer admit to-day; yet, against your will even, you\nwill love me again and give me your blessing, for you will feel the\nrightful authority of this man, who is more to me than all other men,\nand to whom God has given only the words of truth. Yes, I love him.--I\nlove you, you whom I came near losing to-day, and I will never leave you\nagain. I will follow you everywhere; your child shall be mine, as your\ncountry is my country, your faith my faith. There is no higher honor in\nthis world, there is no other virtue before God, than loving you,\nserving you, and comforting you.\"\n\nM. de Villemer stood there, radiant with a pure joy, which dazzled\nCaroline, but did not frighten her. In this hour of enthusiasm there was\nnot even the memory of a trouble. He pressed her to his heart with that\nsacred paternal feeling which belonged to his nature, and which arose\nfrom an instinctive idea of protection,--the rightful authority of a\nhigh intelligence over a noble heart, of a superior mind over another\nmind raised by its love to the same level.\n\nThey did not ask themselves whether this lofty rapture would endure\nalways. It must be said, to their praise, that they felt the infinite\ntenderness of friendship,--enthusiastic, it is true, but deep and\nsincere,--rather than any other intoxication; and that the aim of their\nfuture was, at this moment, defined and summed up in their minds in this\none resolution,--never to forsake each other.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nAt about four o\'clock, while the brightening skies permitted Peyraque to\nmake preparations for their return, by hiring another cart well provided\nwith straw and blankets, together with oxen and a skilful teamster, so\nas to reach Laussonne before evening, the young and beautiful Duchess\nd\'Aléria, robed in moire, her arms loaded with cameos, came into the\napartment of her mother-in-law at the castle of Mauveroche, in Limousin,\nleaving her husband and Madame d\'Arglade chatting with apparent\nfriendliness in a magnificent drawing-room.\n\nDiana had an air of joyful triumph, which struck the Marchioness.\n\n\"Well, what is it, my beauty?\" asked the old lady. \"What has happened!\nHas my other son returned!\"\n\n\"He will come soon,\" replied the Duchess. \"You have the promise of it,\nand, you know, we feel no uneasiness on his account. His brother knows\nwhere he is, and declares we shall see him again by the end of the week.\nSo you find me excessively gay,--excessively happy, even--This little\nMadame d\'Arglade is delightful. Dear mamma, she is the source of all my\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"O, you are jesting, little masquerader! You can\'t endure her. Why have\nyou brought her here? I did n\'t request it. No one can amuse me but\nyou.\"\n\n\"And I undertake it more bravely than ever,\" replied Diana, with a\nbewitching smile, \"and this very D\'Arglade whom I adore is going to\nfurnish me with weapons against your wretched melancholy. Listen, dear,\ngood mamma. At last we have got her awful secret, though not without\ntrouble, by any means. For three days we have been manœuvring round\nher,--the Duke and I,--overpowering her with our mutual trust, our\nsurrender of ourselves to happiness, our most graceful tenderness. At\nlast, the estimable woman, who is n\'t our dupe, and whom our aggravating\nmockeries drove to extremity, has given me to understand that Caroline\nhad for an accomplice in her great fault--O, you know whom. She has told\nyou. I pretended not to understand; it was a little thrust right into my\nheart,--no, a deep thrust, I must tell the truth,--but I hastened to\nfind my dear Duke, and flung it squarely in his face. \'Is it true, you\ndreadful man, that you have been in love with Mlle de Saint-Geneix!\' The\nDuke sprang like a cat,--no, like a leopard whose paw has been trodden\non. \'There! I was sure of it,\' said he, roaring; \'it is our good Léonie\nwho has invented that.\' And then he began to talk of killing her, so I\nhad to quiet him and tell him I did n\'t believe it, which was n\'t quite\ntrue; I did believe it a little bit. And this son of yours, who is n\'t\ndull,--he perceived that, and he flung himself at my feet, and he\nswore--O! but he did swear by all that I believe and love, by the true\nGod, and then by you, that it was an infamous lie; and now I am as sure\nof this as I am that I came into the world for nothing else but just to\nlove his Grace the Duke.\"\n\nThe Duchess had a childish lisp, as natural as Madame d\'Arglade\'s was\naffected, and she united with this a tone of resolute sincerity that\nmade her perfectly charming. The Marchioness had no time to wonder over\nwhat she heard, for the Duke came in as triumphant as his wife.\n\n\"There!\" cried he. \"God be praised, you will never see that viper again!\nShe has called for her carriage; she is going off furious, but with no\npoison in her fangs. I can answer for that. Mother, my poor mother, how\nyou have been deceived. I can appreciate your suffering. And you would\nn\'t say a word, not even to me, who could in a breath--But I have\nconfessed her, this odious woman, who would have brought despair into my\nhousehold, if Diana were not an angel from heaven, against whom the\nPowers of Darkness will never prevail. Well, mother, be a little vexed\nwith us all; it will do you good. Madame d\'Arglade saw,--did she\nnot?--with her own two eyes, saw Mlle de Saint-Geneix leaning on my arm\nand crossing the lawn of Séval at daybreak! She saw me speak to her\naffectionately and shake hands with her? Well, she didn\'t see the whole,\nfor I kissed her hands one after the other, and what she did n\'t\noverhear I\'m going to tell you, for I remember as well as if it happened\nyesterday,--I was excited enough for that. I said to her, \'My brother\nhas been at the point of death to-night, and you have saved him. Pity\nhim, still keep him under your care, help me to hide his illness from\nour mother, and, thanks to you, he will not die.\' That is what I said, I\nswear it before Heaven, and this is what had taken place.\"\n\nThe Duke recounted the whole, and, going into the matter more thoroughly\nstill, even confessed his false notions about Caroline and his fruitless\nmanœuvring which she had not even perceived. He described the outburst\nof jealousy against him on the part of the Marquis; their disagreement\nfor one hour; their passionate reconciliation; the confession of the\none, the solemn oaths of the other; the discovery he made at that moment\nof his brother\'s alarming condition; his own imprudence in leaving him,\nthinking him asleep and comfortable; the broken window-pane, the cries\nCaroline overheard; and Caroline herself rushing to his aid, reviving\nthe sick man, staying beside him, devoting herself from that time onward\nto caring for him, amusing him, and aiding him in his work.\n\n\"And all this,\" added the Duke, \"with a devotedness, a frankness, a\nforgetfulness of self, unequalled in all my experience. This Caroline,\nyou see, is a woman of rare worth, and I have sought in vain for a\nperson who would suit my brother better in point of age, character,\nmodesty, or congenial tastes. I do not find one anywhere. You know I\nhave desired to have him make a more brilliant match. Well, now that he\nis safe from serious embarrassment, thanks to this angel here who has\nrestored us all to freedom and dignity; now that I have seen the\npersistence and strength of my brother\'s love for a person who is, more\nthan all others, the sincere friend he needs; and, lastly, now that\nDiana understands all this better than I and exhorts me to believe in\nlove-matches, I have, dear mother, only one thing to say, which is, that\nwe must find Caroline again, and you must cheerfully give her your\nblessing as the best friend you ever had, except my wife, and the best\ndaughter you can wish beside her.\"\n\n\"O my children!\" cried the Marchioness, \"you make me so happy. I have\nhardly lived since this calumny. Urbain\'s grief, the absence of this\nchild who was dear to me, the fear of setting at variance two brothers\nso perfectly united, if I acknowledged what I supposed to be true, what\nI am so glad find false. We must hasten after the Marquis, after\nCaroline; but where, for Heaven\'s sake? You know where your brother is;\nbut he,--does he know where she is?\"\n\n\"No, he set out without knowing,\" replied the Duchess; \"but Madame\nHeudebert knows.\"\n\n\"Write her, dear mother; tell her the truth, and she will tell\nCaroline.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I am going to write,\" said the Marchioness; \"but how can I\nlet poor Urbain know at once?\"\n\n\"I will take charge of that,\" said the Duke. \"I would go myself, if the\nDuchess could go with me, but to leave her for three days,--on my word,\nit is too soon!\"\n\n\"Fie!\" cried the Duchess; \"as soon as the honeymoon is over do you mean\nto be running off without me in that way, light-hearted and light-footed\ntoo? Ah! how mistaken you are, you charming man! I shall keep you in\norder, with all your inconstancy.\"\n\n\"And pray how will you do it, then?\" asked the Duke, looking at her\nfondly.\n\n\"By loving you always more and more. We shall see whether you grow weary\nof it.\"\n\nWhile the Duke was caressing the golden hair of his wife, the\nMarchioness was writing to Camille with a youthful sprightliness which\nwas certainly remarkable. \"Here, my children,\" said she, \"is this\nright?\" The Duchess read, \"My dear Madame Heudebert, bring Caroline back\nto us, and let me embrace you both. She has been the victim of a\nhorrible slander; I know all. I weep for having believed in the fall of\nan angel. May she forgive me! Let her come back; let her be my daughter\nalways and never leave me again. There are two of us who cannot live\nwithout her.\"\n\n\"That is delightful! It is kind and just like you,\" said the Duchess,\nsealing up the note; and the Duke rang while his mother was writing the\naddress.\n\nThe message being despatched, she said to them, \"Why can\'t you both go\nafter the Marquis! Is he so very far off!\"\n\n\"Twelve hours by post, at the very most,\" replied the Duke.\n\n\"And I cannot know where he is?\"\n\n\"I ought not to tell you; but I\'m convinced he will now have no more\nsecrets from you. Happiness induces confidence.\"\n\n\"My son,\" returned the Marchioness, \"you alarm me seriously. Perhaps\nyour brother is here sick, and you are hiding it from me, as you did at\nSéval. He is worse even; you make me believe he is away because he is\nn\'t able to be up.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Diana, laughing; \"he is n\'t here, he is n\'t sick. He is\nabroad, he is travelling, he is sad, perhaps; but he is going to be\nhappy now, and he did n\'t start without some hope of mollifying you.\"\n\nThe Duke solemnly assured his mother that his wife was telling the\ntruth. \"Well, my children,\" resumed the Marchioness, still uneasy, \"I\nwish I could know you were with him. How shall I say it?--He has never\nbeen ill but that I have suspected it or at least felt a peculiar\nuneasiness. I was conscious of this at Séval, exactly at the period\nwhen he was so ill without my knowledge. I see that what you describe\ncoincides with a fearful night which I passed then. Well, to-day, this\nmorning, I was all alone, and I had what I may call a waking dream. I\nsaw the Marquis pale, wrapped in something white, a shroud, perhaps, and\nI heard in my ear his voice, his own voice, saying, \'Mother.\'\"\n\n\"Heavens! what fancies you torment yourself with!\" said the Duke.\n\n\"I don\'t torment myself willingly; and I let my presentiments comfort\nme, for I want to tell you the whole. For an hour past I have known that\nmy son is well; but he has been in danger to-day. He has suffered,--or\nit may have been an accident. Remember now the day and the hour.\"\n\n\"There! you must go,\" said the Duchess to her husband. \"I don\'t believe\na word of all this, but we must reassure your mother.\"\n\n\"You shall go with him,\" said the Marchioness. \"I don\'t want my gloomy\nnotions, which, after all, are perhaps morbid and nothing else, to give\nyou the first annoyance of your married life.\"\n\n\"And leave you alone with these ideas!\"\n\n\"They will all vanish as soon as I see you going after him.\"\n\nThe Marchioness insisted. The Duchess ordered a light trunk; and two\nhours afterward she was travelling by post with her husband through\nTulle and Aurillac, on the way to Le Puy.\n\nThe Duchess knew the secret of her brother-in-law; she was ignorant of\nthe mother\'s name, but aware of the existence of the child. The Marquis\nhad authorized the Duke to have no secrets from his wife.\n\nAt six in the morning they reached Polignac. The first face which\nattracted Diana\'s notice was that of Didier. She was impressed, as\nCaroline had been, with a sudden impulse of tenderness toward this dear\nlittle creature, who captivated all hearts. While she was looking at him\nand petting him, the Duke inquired for the pretended M. Bernyer. \"My\ndear,\" said he to his wife, coming back, \"my mother was right; some\naccident has happened to my brother. He went away yesterday morning for\na few hours\' ramble over the mountain, but has not returned yet. The\npeople here are uneasy about him.\"\n\n\"Do they know where he went?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is beyond Le Puy. The post will carry us so far, and I can\nleave you there. I shall take a horse and a guide, for there is no road\npassable for carriages.\"\n\n\"We will take two horses,\" said the Duchess. \"I\'m not tired a bit; let\nus start.\"\n\nAn hour after the intrepid Diana, lighter than a bird, was galloping up\nthe slope of the Gâgne and laughing at her husband\'s anxiety about her.\nAt nine o\'clock in the morning they were swiftly passing through\nLantriac, to the great wonderment of the townspeople, alighting soon at\nthe Peyraque-Lanion domicile to the equally great disgust of the village\ninnkeeper.\n\nThe family were at table in the little workshop. The wanderers had\nreturned the night before after some slight detention, but without\naccident. The Marquis, weary but not sick, had accepted the hospitality\nof Peyraque\'s son, who lived near by. Caroline had slept delightfully in\nher little room. She was helping Justine to wait upon \"the men of the\nhouse,\" that is, the Marquis and the two Peyraques. Radiant with\nhappiness she went back and forth, now waiting on the rest, and now\nseating herself opposite M. de Villemer, who let her have her own way,\nwatching her with delight, as if to say, \"I permit this now, but how I\nshall repay all these attentions, by and by!\"\n\nWhat an outburst of joy and surprise filled Peyraque\'s house at the\nappearance of the travellers! The two brothers gave each other a long\nhugging. Diana embraced Caroline, calling her \"sister.\"\n\nThey spent an hour talking over everything by snatches, extravagantly,\nwithout comprehending one another, without feeling sure they were not\nall dreaming. The Duke was almost famished and found Justine\'s dishes\nexcellent, for she prepared another plentiful breakfast, while Caroline\nassisted her, laughing and weeping at the same time. Diana was in a\nwildly venturesome mood, and wanted to undertake seasoning the dishes,\nto her husband\'s great dismay. At last they seriously resumed their\nrespective explanations and recitals. The Marquis began by sending off a\ncourier to Le Puy with a letter for his mother, whose anxiety and\nstrange presentiments they had mentioned the first thing.\n\nThey shed no tears on quitting the Peyraques, for these good people had\npromised to come to the wedding. The next day they had reached\nMauveroche again with Didier, whom the Marquis placed in his mother\'s\nlap. She had been prepared for this by her son\'s letter. She loaded the\nchild with caresses, and, restoring him to Caroline\'s arms, she said,\n\"My daughter, you accept, then, the task of making us all happy? Take my\nblessing a thousand times over, and if you would keep me here a long\nwhile, never leave me again. I have done you much harm, my poor angel;\nbut God has not allowed it to last long, for I should have died from it\nsooner than you.\"\n\n\nThe Marquis and his wife passed the rest of the bright season at\nMauveroche, and a few autumnal days at Séval. This place was very dear\nto them; and, in spite of the pleasure at meeting their relatives again\nin Paris, it was not without an effort that they tore themselves away\nfrom a nook consecrated by such memories.\n\nThe marriage of the Marquis astounded no one; some approved, others\ndisdainfully predicted that he would repent this eccentricity, that he\nwould be forsaken by all reasonable people, that his life was a ruin, a\nfailure. The Marchioness came near suffering a little from these\nremarks. Madame d\'Arglade pursued Diana, Caroline, and their husbands\nwith her hatred; but everything fell before the revolution of February,\nand people had to think of other matters. The Marchioness was terribly\nfrightened, and thought it expedient to seek refuge at Séval, where she\nwas happy in spite of herself. The Marquis, just as his anonymous book\nwas about to appear, postponed its publication to a more quiet period.\nHe was unwilling to strike the sufferers of the day. Blest with love and\nfamily joys, he is not impatient for glory.\n\nThe old Marchioness is now no more. Feeble in body and far too active in\nmind, her days have been numbered. She passed away in the midst of her\nchildren and grandchildren, blessing them all without knowing she was\nleaving them, conscious of bodily infirmities, but preserving her\nintellectual force and natural kindliness to the last, and laying plans,\nas most invalids do, for the next year.\n\nThe Duke is growing quite fleshy in his prosperity; but is still\ngood-humored, handsome, and active enough. He lives in great luxury, but\nwithout extravagance; referring everything to his wife, who governs him,\nand keeps him on his good behavior, with rare tact and admirable\njudgment, notwithstanding the indulgent spoiling of her fondness for\nhim. We would not assert that he has never thought of deceiving her; but\nshe has contrived to counteract his fancies without letting him suspect\nit, and her triumph, which still endures, proves once more that there\nare sometimes wit and power enough in the brain of a girl of sixteen to\nsettle the destiny, and that in the best possible way, of a professed\nprofligate. The Duke, still wonderfully good-natured and somewhat weak,\nfinds more delight than one would think in giving over his skilfully\nplanned treacheries toward the fair sex, and in going to sleep, without\nfurther remorse, on the pillow of comfortable propriety.\n\nThe Marquis and the new Marchioness de Villemer now pass eight months of\nthe year at Séval, always occupied--we cannot say with one another,\nbecause they are so united that they think together and answer each\nother before the question is asked, but--with the education of their\nchildren, who are all sprightly and intelligent. M. de G---- is dead.\nMadame de G---- has been forgotten. Didier is formally recognized by the\nMarquis as one of his children. Caroline no longer remembers that she is\nnot his mother.\n\nMadame Heudebert is established at Séval. All her children are brought\nup under the united care of the Marquis and Caroline. The sons of the\nDuke, petted more, are not so intelligent or so strong; but they are\namiable and full of precocious graces. The Duke is an excellent father,\nand is astonished, though quite needlessly, to find that his children\nare already so large.\n\nThe Peyraques have been loaded with gifts. Last year Urbain and Caroline\nwent back to visit them, and, this time, they climbed, under a fine\nsunrise, the silvery peak of Mézenc. They also wanted to see once more\nthe poor cabin where, in spite of the Marquis and his liberality,\nnothing is changed for the better; but the father has bought land and\nthinks himself wealthy. Caroline seated herself with pleasure by the\nmiserable hearth, where she had seen at her feet, for the first time,\nthe man with whom she would have willingly shared a hut in the\nCévennes, and forgetfulness of the whole world.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Marquis de Villemer, by George Sand\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARQUIS DE VILLEMER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 63083-0.txt or 63083-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/3/0/8/63083/\n\nProduced by Dagny and Laura Natal Rodrigues at Free\nLiterature (Images generously made available by Hathi\nTrust.)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n',2);
